            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>thee alſo, by the bloud of the Covenant, I have ſent forth thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners out of the pit, wherein is no water.</hi> How pretious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſions are the treaſures of Gods love in the Covenant of Promiſe! Theſe mines are digged up and diſcovered in this diſcourſe, many obſcure Scriptures, full of rich Goſpell-Grace are here interpreted from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall languages, and by a judicious comparing of one place with another. The book (I believe) will commend it ſelf unto the conſiderate Reader: and becauſe ſo many godly, learned, well-approved brethren, have been pleaſed to honour it with their atteſtation, therefore my further teſtimony would be altogether needleſs and unſeaſonable. If the phraſe of ſpeech ſeeme ſometimes knotty and unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, I deſire that ſerious attention may take off that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. A little diligence doth often conquer great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing difficulties, and love of truth will make labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſearching after the knowledge of it. The Lord direct and proſper thy peruſall of this Treatiſe, that thereby thy ſoul may be edified in grace and comfort, through the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his glorious Promiſes in the Lord our Saviour, in whom, and for whom, I will endeavour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove my ſelf,</p>

                  </gap> in the generall ſignification; For <hi>Camerarius</hi> citeth out of <hi>Aristophan. de Avibus,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, uſed for to make a Covenant. The Papiſts carpe at our Interpreters, becauſe they render the word Covenant, rather then Teſtament: for they would have it to ſignifie a teſtamentary diſpoſition. But they are deceived, for the ſignification of the word is more generall: and the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 16. argueth not from the ſimple ſignification of the word, but the circumſtances of the Covenant. In a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Teſtament both, there is an ordination and diſpoſition of things according to pleaſure: and the Greeke phraſe in the New Teſtament doth follow the received Interpretation of the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint;</hi> although in this the Covenant of Grace is like to a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is not eſtabliſhed but by the death of the Mediatour as of a Teſtator.</p>
               <p>The Covenant in Scripture doth ſometimes ſignifie an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promiſe of God, without any ſtipulation at all, ſuch as was the Covenant which God made with <hi>Noah</hi> preſently after the Floud, promiſing freely, that he would never deſtroy man and beaſts with an univerſall deluge of water any more. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 11.

Of this kind is the Covenant wherein God promiſeth that he will give his elect faith and perſeverance, to which promiſe no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Jer. 33. 20.</note> annexed can be conceived in mind, which is not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Promiſe it ſelfe. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
               <p>But oftentimes in holy Writ the name Covenant is ſo uſed, that in it is plainly ſignified a free Promiſe of God, but with ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of duty from the reaſonable creature, which otherwiſe was due, no promiſe comming betwixt, and might have been<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 16.

For a Covenant is <hi>quiddam complexum,</hi> implying two things, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed either <hi>re</hi> or <hi>ratione,</hi> the one covenanting, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulating or accepting. As alſo two parts covenanted. Firſt, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55916:7"/> giving of ſome future good. Secondly, the retribution of ſome performance. The firſt without the ſecond, is no more then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe: the ſecond without the firſt is no leſſe then a Law, though the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. makes another oppoſition of Law and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, nature and faith, workes and Chriſt, for that is from a divers acceptation of the Promiſe. But when two perſons upon theſe two parts concurre, it is that we call a Covenant properly: though tropically ſometimes the Promiſe, and ſometimes the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation only is noted by the Covenant. <hi>Pſal. 50. 5. Nehem. 1. 5. Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 9. and ſometimes the ſeale of the Covenant is called the Covenant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction of the Covenant depends upon a diſtinction of Gods love; for there is a love of God towards the creature, whence all the good that is in the creature doth flow, and there is a love of God vouchſafed to the creature, and that for thoſe things which it hath received, not of it ſelfe, but of God, as it was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with that firſt love. That we may call primary or antecedent (for diſtinction ſake) this ſecondary or conſequent love. From that flowes both the making and fulfilling of the Abſolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: on this depends the fulfilling of the Covenant, whereunto a reſtipulation is annexed, but not the making thereof. For in the Abſolute Covenant there is nothing in the creature that might move God, either to promiſe, or to performe what he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but in the Covenant to which a ſtipulation is annexed, God fulfils what he promiſed, becauſe the creature exhibits what was exacted, although this that God hath entered into ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and promiſed ſo great things unto him that performed ſuch and ſuch obedience, that wholly proceeds from the antecedent love, and free pleaſure of Almighty God. The eſſance of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant properly conſiſteth in the Promiſe and ſtipulation: But the words of the Covenant containe obedience required of God, and promiſed of them in Covenant, and ſo by a Metonymie are called the Covenant. <hi>Exod. 34. 27, 28. Deut. 29. 1. Jer.</hi> 11. 2, 3, 4. and 34. 13, 14. The Tables of the Law were the Tables of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The Covenant and Law differ, as friendſhip and tables obligatory to friendſhip: he that violates theſe, is convinced to breake this: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1, 2. and the tables of the Covenant of Law are called the Covenant or Teſtament, and the Book of the Covenant. <hi>Exod. 24. 4, 7. 2 King.</hi> 23. 2. A Covenant is made betwixt men
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55916:7"/> of thoſe things, which either were not due before, or were not thought to be due, which are made firme, ſtable and due by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Covenant, ſo that by the Covenant new right is acquired or cauſed, either to one or both, who Covenant betwixt themſelves of any matter. Therefore the Covenant of God doth contain new things, great, and in no wiſe due, which of his meere pleaſure God offers unto us. Now where there is huge and infinite diſparity, there can be no aſſurance of this ſo great a gift, but the certaine Word of God, and the aſſured Promiſe of him who doth never lie, nor change. That therefore Man ſhould enter into Covenant with God, it was neceſſary that men ſhould firſt give credit to the Word of God, and then that they ſhould hope for thoſe things which exceed their capacity, and ſo at laſt truſting in God and obeying, they ſhould obtaine the good things promiſed: and<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 6, 7, 8.</note> therefore the words of the Covenant may well be put for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Nevertheleſſe in making Covenant with the creature God is not tied to verball expreſſions, but often he contracts the Covenant in reall impreſſions in the heart and frame of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is apparent in the Covenant ſo often mentioned with the unreaſonable creature, and this was the manner of covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with our firſt parents in the ſtate of Innocency: but is mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Covenant is one thing, the name of the Covenant another. For the Covenant includes the whole reaſon of the Covenant with the circumſtances: but the name ſometimes is attributed to ſome circumſtances.

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the Covenant God made with man in the ſtate of Innocencie.</head>
               <p>IT hath pleaſed God to deale with the reaſonable creature, by way of Promiſe and reſtipulation, that is, by way of Covenant: In which God himſelfe is one partie covenanting and promiſing, and the whole reaſonable creature, the other reſtipulating and obeying. The thing holden out by God is eternall life with all immediate bleſſings, the condition on the part of the reaſonable creature is free, ready and willing obedience, whether from nature or grace. The cauſes why God made choice to deale with the reaſonable creature in this manner are principally three. Firſt, that the creature might know what to expect from the Creator, into what ſtate ſoever caſt. Secondly, that the ſame creature might alwayes recognize, and acknowledge what to retribute. Thirdly, Such manner of dealing ſuites beſt with the nature of the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, and his ſubordination to the Almighty. But paſſing by what might be ſpoken of the Covenant with reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, both men and Angels: we will only conſider what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God hath made with mankind, becauſe the knowledge thereof doth in ſpeciall manner concerne us, and in the unfolding thereof the Scripture is moſt plentifull. We reade not the word Covenant betwixt God and man, ever ſince the Creation, both in Innocency, and under the fall: but we have in Scripture what may amount to as much. As in Innocency God provided and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> eternall happineſſe in the preſent injoyments, and cals for perfect obedience: which appeares from Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. For if man muſt die if he diſobeyed, it implies ſtrongly that Gods Covenant was with him for life, if he obeyed. And after the fall, it is moſt evident, God was pleaſed to hold this courſe with man, in all ages and conditions, but with ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55916:8"/> as ſeemed beſt in his infinite wiſedome, and beſt fitted the preſent condition of the creature. In this manner hath God afforded both the prime and ſecondary good unto man under Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants and ſeales, that he might have the greater aſſurance, ſo long as he walked in obedience: and herein God was pleaſed to condeſcend to mans weakneſſe, and for the confirmation of his faith to adde Seales to his Covenants, in all times to bind the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The Covenant in generall may be deſcribed, a mutuall compact or agreement betwixt God and man, whereby God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth all good things, ſpecially eternall happineſſe unto man, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt, equall and favourable conditions, and man doth promiſe to walk before God in all acceptable, free and willing obedience, expecting all good from God, and happineſſe in God, according to his Promiſe, for the praiſe and glory of his great Name.</p>
               <p>The Author of the Covenant is God, not God and man, for God doth enter into Covenant with man, not as his equall, but as his Soveraigne, and man is bound to accept of the conditions offered by the Lord. There can be no ſuch equality of power and authority betwixt God and the creature, as that he ſhould indent with the moſt High, but he muſt accept what the Lord is well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to offer and command. The Covenant is of God, and that of his free grace and love: for although in ſome Covenant the good covenanted be promiſed in juſtice, and given in juſtice for our workes: yet it was of grace that God was pleaſed to bind himſelfe to his creature, and above the deſert of the creature: and though the reward be of juſtice, it is alſo of favour. For after perfect obedience performed according to the will of God, it had been no injuſtice in God, as he made the creature of nothing, ſo to have brought him unto nothing: it was then of grace that he was pleaſed to make that promiſe, and of the ſame grace his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe ſhould have been continued. The partees covenanting are God and man: for God promiſeth unto man upon condition, and man promiſeth unto God what he requireth. In reſpect of Gods promiſe the Covenant is called his: but in reſpect of the conditions, it may be called mans. God promiſeth freely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence<note place="margin">Zech. 9. 11. In the bloud of thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Sept. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55916:9"/> forme of the Covenant ſtands in a Promiſe and reſtipulation, wherein the Lord, though he might have required the whole<note place="margin">To will and to nill the ſame things is the ſure bond of all amity and friendſhip. Now becauſe the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and us is of infinite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his will is a Law to us, and our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is true love to him.</note> debt of obedience, without promiſe of reward, in reſpect of the good things already beſtowed upon the creature, yet to the end that man might yeeld cheerfull and free obedience, he firſt bound himſelfe to reward the obedience of man, before he bound man unto him in obedience.</p>
               <p>The Subject of this Covenant in generall is man not differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by ſpeciall reſpects: for as the Law was given, ſo the Goſpell is revealed to man. Man in this or that ſpeciall conſideration is the ſubject of the Covenant, as it is divided for kinds, or altered for circumſtances, and degrees: but man is the ſubject of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant without ſuch particular conſiderations. The Lord having reſpect to the mutability and weakneſſe of mans nature, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as to try his obedience by Symbolicall precepts, ſo to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the aſſurance of his faithfull promiſe by outward ſeales: but when the creature ſhall grow to abſolute perfection and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſſe, ſuch ſymbolicall precepts and outward ſeales ſhall ceaſe as needleſſe. The good promiſed is eternall bleſſedneſſe with all good things that doe accompany it, or belong thereunto: the good required is obedience to the juſt and righteous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, which he as our Soveraigne Lord doth claime and call for, according as he ſhall preſcribe and appoint. The end thereof is the glory of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the praiſe of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, juſtice and bountie. And in all theſe things the Covenants howſoever divided in kinds, or varied in degrees and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe ſweetly conſent and agree. But ſeeing the Covenant is not one, but manifold, both in kinds and degrees, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it, and weigh more diligently what doth agree to every kind, and whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ein they agree, and wherein they differ one from another. Some diſtinguiſh thus, the Covenant is either of Nature, or of Grace, or ſubſervient to both, which is called the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Others thus, the Covenant is Legall or Evangelicall, of works, or of grace. The Covenant of workes, wherein God covenanteth with man to give him eternall life upon condition of perfect obedience in his owne perſon. The Covenant of Grace, which God maketh with man promiſing eternall life upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of beleeving. And this diſtinction is one for ſubſtance with the former: and with that which may be taken from the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55916:9"/> ſpeciall conſideration of the ſubject with whom it was made, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocencie, or with man after the Fall. We reade not in Scripture, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, or of grace <hi>totidem ſyllabis:</hi> the neereſt we come to it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. the Law of works oppoſed to the Law of faith; which holds out as much as the Covenant of workes, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. For there the Apoſtle is diſputing about juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and by conſequent eternall Salvation, which is Gods part to give under a Covenant. But of this hereafter. The Covenant which God made with our firſt parents, is that mutuall contract or agreement, wherein God promiſed eternall happineſſe to man upon condition of intire and perfect obedience to be performed in his owne perſon.</p>
               <p>The Author of this Covenant was God his Creator and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, who had beſtowed many and great bleſſings upon man, furniſhed him with excellent abilities, and enriched him with ſingular priviledges. This Covenant God made in Juſtice; yet ſo as it was of Grace likewiſe to make ſuch a free promiſe, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo great things upon man for his obedience. God did in ſtrict juſtice require obedience, promiſe a reward, and threaten puniſhment: but yet as bountifull and gratious unto his creature, intire and perfect, if he ſhould ſo continue. God did in juſtice proportion the reward and the worke, the weight of the bleſſing promiſed, and the work of obedience required: but yet I cannot thinke it had been injuſtice in God to have given leſſe, or not to have continued ſo great things to man, ſo long as he continued his obedience: No, God was pleaſed to manifeſt his goodneſſe to man continuing in obedience, no leſſe then his juſtice, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in creation he had ſhewed himſelfe exceeding gratious to man, above other viſible and corporall creatures.</p>
               <p>This Covenant God made with man without a Mediatour: for there needed no middle perſon to bring man into favour and friendſhip with God, becauſe man did beare the image of God, and had not offended: nor to procure acceptance to mans ſervice, becauſe it was pure and ſpotleſſe. God did love man being made after his Image: and promiſed to accept of his obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed freely, willingly, intirely, according to his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The forme of this Covenant ſtood in the ſpeciall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of good to be received from juſtice as a reward for his work,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55916:10"/> 
                  <hi>Doe this and live:</hi> and the exact and rigid exaction of perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in his own perſon, without the leaſt ſpot or failing for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or manner. The good that God promiſed was in it kind a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſyſteme of good, which was to be continued ſo long as he continued obedient, which becauſe it might be continued in the eye of creating power for ever, we call it happineſſe, life, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſſe. But upon a ſuppoſition of <hi>Adams</hi> perſiſting in a ſtate of obedience, to ſay that God would have tranſlated him to the ſtate of glory in Heaven, is more then any juſt ground will warrant; becauſe in Scripture there is no ſuch promiſe. And if we muſt not preſume above what is written, we may ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have continued in that bleſſed eſtate in which he was created, but as for his tranſlation after ſome number of yeares ſpent on earth, we reade it not. In this ſtate and condition <hi>Adams</hi> obedience ſhould have been rewarded in juſtice, but he could not have merited that reward. Happineſſe ſhould have been conferred upon him, or continued unto him for his works, but they had not deſerved the continuance thereof: for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the creature ſhould merit of the Creator, becauſe when he hath done all that he can, he is an unprofitable ſervant, he hath<note place="margin">Luke 17. 10.</note> done but his duty. The obedience that God required at his hands was partly naturall, to be regulated according to the Law engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in his heart by the finger of God himſelfe, conſiſting in the true, unfained and perfect love of God, and of his Neighbour for the Lords ſake: and partly Symbolicall, which ſtood in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law given for his probation and triall, whether he would ſubmit to the good pleaſure of God in an act of it ſelfe meerely indifferent, becauſe he was ſo commanded. Though God had put many abilities and honourable priviledges upon man, yet he remained his Soveraigne, which by an act of reſtraint, he was pleaſed to make man thus exalted to know, which he did by requiring and commanding his creature to abſtain from one fruit in it ſelfe pleaſant to the eye, and good for meat. This was mans Homage-penny, a thing before the command indifferent, unto which he had a naturall inclination, from which he was now to abſtaine, becauſe God (who had before given to man as part of his patrimony, and not as reward of his obedience to this particular reſtraint, liberty to eat of every tree of the Garden) here interpoſed himſelfe and reſerved this as an Homage unto himſelf.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55916:10"/> God in his Soveraignty ſet a puniſhment upon the breach of this<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 16.</note> his Commandement, that man might know his inferiority, and that things betwixt him and God were not as between equals. The ſubject of this Covenant is man intire and perfect, made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of God in Righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not only with a reaſonable ſoule and faculties beſeeming, but with divine qualities breathed from the whole Trinity, infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole man, lifting up every faculty and power above his firſt frame, and inabling and fitting him to obey the will of God intirely, willingly, exactly, for matter and meaſure. Whether this was naturall or ſupernaturall unto the firſt man, is a queſtion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to be diſputed in this place, and peradventure if the termes be rightly underſtood, will be no great controverſie. Only this muſt be acknowledged, that this was <hi>Adams</hi> excellencie above all the creatures, and that in the fallen creature this quality is ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. Unto this mutuall Covenant God added a ſeale to aſſure the protoplaſt of his performance and perſiſting in Covenant with him, and further to ſtrengthen his obedience, with the obedience of his poſterity, which upon his breach with God was made void. This Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been the ſame unto his whole poſterity, if he had continued as in all after Covenants of God, they are made with Head and Root, reaching unto all the branches and members iſſuing from them, <hi>Rom. 5. 17. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 22, 47. The proportion holding in <hi>Abraham</hi> to Chriſt, till the Covenant be rejected in after commers. But this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was ſo made with <hi>Adam</hi> the root of all mankind, that if tranſgreſſed, his whole poſterity ſhould be liable to the curſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall, which entred upon his fall. This Covenant was a Covenant of friendſhip not of reconciliation; being once broken it could not be repaired; it promiſed no mercy or pardon, admitted no repentance, accepted no obedience, but what was perfect and compleat. If <hi>Adam</hi> had a thought after his breach, that he might have healed the matter, it was but vaine preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and leaſt he ſhould rely upon a vaine confidence in eating of the tree of life, God drove him out of the Garden. But this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was not peremptory, not the laſt nor unchangeable. Woe to all the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> if God ſhould deale with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſentence here denounced. When man had plunged himſelfe into miſery, it pleaſed the Lord to reveale his abundant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55916:11"/> Grace in the Covenant of Grace, of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>The end of this Covenant is the demonſtration of Gods wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, bounty, goodneſſe and juſtice, both rewarding and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and it made way for the manifeſtation of his rich grace and abundant free mercy brought to light in the ſecond Covenant.</p>
               <p>Three queſtions may be moved here not unprofitable, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent. 1. Why in the Covenant of nature (as it is called) <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>1</label> God doth not expreſſely require Faith, but Obedience and Love. And the anſwer is, That only by conſequent Faith is required, and not expreſſely in this Covenant, becauſe there was not the leaſt probable cauſe or ſuſpition why man ſhould doubt of Gods love, for ſinne had not as yet entred into the world: but in the Covenant of Grace it was contrary, for that is made with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience terrified with ſinne, which could be raiſed up by none other meanes, but by the free Promiſe of mercy, and Faith imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Word of Promiſe, freely and faithfully tendered, and to be received by faith only.</p>
               <p>Againe, in this Covenant is conſidered, what in exact juſtice man doth owe unto God: (but he oweth juſtice and Sanctity:) but in the Covenant of Grace what God reconciled to man in his Sonne, would offer, and that is bountifully offered.</p>
               <p>2. How that Faith, which preſuppoſeth exact juſtice in the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>2</label> Covenant of Nature, differs from that Faith which is required in the Covenant of Grace?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Faith, which the exact righteouſneſſe of man in the Covenant of Nature, doth preſuppoſe, agreeth with faith which is required in the Covenant of Grace in this, that both are of God, both is a perſwaſion concerning the love of God, both begette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h in man mutuall love of God, becauſe if faith abounds, love abounds; languiſhing, it languiſheth; and being extinct, it is extinguiſhed. But they differ firſt in the Foundation. For Faith which the Righteouſneſſe of nature preſuppoſeth, leaneth on the title of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire nature, and therefore after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> it hath no place; for although God love the creatures in themſelves, yet he hates them corrupted with ſinne. No man therefore can perſwade himſelfe, that he is beloved of God in the title of a creature; (for all have ſinned) nor love God as he ought. But the Faith, of which there is mention in the Covenant of Grace, doth leane upon the Promiſe made in Chriſt. Secondly, when both are of God, yes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55916:11"/> that faith which exact righteouſneſſe preſuppoſeth is of God (as they ſpeake in Schooles) <hi>per modum naturae:</hi> But the Faith requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Covenant of Grace, is of God, but <hi>per modum gratiae ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturalis.</hi> Thirdly, the righteouſneſſe, which the faith of nature begetteth was changeable; becauſe the faith whence it did flow, did depend upon a changeable Principle of nature: But the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, which the Faith of the Covenant of Grace begetteth, is eternall and unchangeable, becauſe it comes from an eternall and unchangeable beginning, the Spirit of Grace.</p>

To this ſome anſwer affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, becauſe many of them, from ſome remainders of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned abilities, did many good things for the good of bodies politicke wherein they lived. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13, 14, 15, 16. which God retributes with good things in this life, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, but to all ſome. And it cannot be denied; but ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Gods Image or notions of good and evill, are to be found amongſt the Heathen: and that theſe things, in them who lived without the pale of the Church, have been increaſed by culture of nature under Diſcipline, by Arts and Exerciſes, and might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive improvement by vicinity to the Church; from which they might learne ſome things to enrich them in this trade: And that God hath beſtowed many and great bleſſings upon them pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this life: But it may be queſtioned, whether theſe things come from the compact of workes, or be gifts of bounty and Gods righteous adminiſtration, for a time reſpiting the ſentence denounced againſt man for breach of Covenant, and vouchſafing unto him ſome temporall good things for the uſe and benefit of humane Society. Yea, it may be worthy conſideration, Whether theſe things be not granted unto them in Jeſus Chriſt, according to the Covenant of Grace, which was made upon the very fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whom not only the Elect, but the whole frame of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived benefit. In the Creation God raiſed up a great Family,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55916:12"/> wherein he made <hi>Adam</hi> the head, and all his poſterity inhabitors, the frame of Heaven and Earth his domicile, the creatures his ſervants, this Family upon the fall was broken up, the preſent Maſter turned out of his imployments, the children beggered, the ſervants returning to God their Soveraigne, and the whole frame of the creature under attainder. God thus defeated, (if I may ſo ſpeake) ſets up a ſecond Family, called the Family of Heaven and Earth, wherein Jeſus Chriſt, the womans ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. is the Head, <hi>Matth. 28. 18. Epheſ. 1. 22. Col.</hi> 1. 19, 20. ſtiled the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Lord of all things in Heaven and Earth, and that with more ſoveraignty and amplitude of injoyment then ever the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had; the whole creature being put under his feet. The children of this Family are the faithfull, who be the adopted Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. ſometimes called the ſeed. The ſervants be the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and thoſe of two ſorts, either ſuch as attend in the Church, neerer about Chriſts perſon, or further off, as in farme-houſes for baſer offices. The creatures, by a ſecond ordinance from their former Maſter free, are ſtated upon Chriſt, though they beare ſome brands of evill from the ſinne of their former Maſter: the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, though not ſo beautifull, returnes to Chriſt. So the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, entring upon the breaking up of the former Family, inveſteth Chriſt with all as purchaſer of the loſt creature from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging juſtice, and as Lord of all things in Heaven and Earth, who freely conferreth the heavenly inheritance upon the adopted ſonnes and brethren, and vouchſafeth earthly bleſſings, and ſome ſpirituall common gifts to the wicked, which may be called ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, both thoſe that more neerly attend his perſon, and thoſe that be further off.

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Covenant of Grace in generall.</head>
               <p>THe Covenant of Grace is that free and gracious Covenant which God of his meere mercy in Jeſus Chriſt made with man a miſerable and wretched ſinner, promiſing unto him pardon of ſinne and eternall happineſſe, if he will return from his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, embrace mercy reached forth, by faith unfained, and walke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55916:12"/> God in ſincere, faithfull and willing obedience, as becomes ſuch a creature lifted up unto ſuch injoyment, and partaker of ſuch pretious promiſes. This Covenant is oppoſite to the former in kind, ſo that at one and the ſame time, man cannot be under the Covenant of workes and the Covenant of grace. For he cannot hope to be juſtified by his perfect and exact obedience, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging himſelfe to be a miſerable and loſt ſinner, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pardon of the free mercy of God in Ieſus Chriſt embraced by faith. The condition of the Law as it was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the neceſſity of mercy reaching to the pardon of ſinne: and the neceſſity of making a new Covenant, argues the former could not give life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. He that is under grace, cannot at the ſame time be under the law: and he that waites for Salvation of meere and rich grace to be vouchſafed, cannot expect it as the deſerved wages of his good worke from juſtice, and not of mercy.</p>
               <p>What then may ſome ſay, is the Law aboliſhed, or is it lawfull for Chriſtians to live as they liſt, becauſe they be not under the Law?</p>
               <p>Not ſo: but the Law hath a double reſpect: one as the unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable rule of life and manners, according to which perſons in Covenant ought to walke before and with the Lord, and in this ſenſe it belongs to the Covenant of grace. The other, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in forme of a Covenant, as if he muſt neceſſarily periſh, who doth neglect or breake it in the leaſt jot or tittle, and in this ſenſe the Covenant of grace and workes are oppoſite. The matter of Evangelicall precepts and of the Morall Law is the ſame, but the forme of promulgation is not the ſame: the rule is one, but the Covenants differ. Materialy the Law, that is, the matter and argument of the Law, as a rule, ſtands in force: but if formally it did continue as a Covenant, there could be no place for repentance, nor for the promiſe of forgiveneſſe, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy reaching to the pardon of ſinne, or the quickning of them that be dead in treſpaſſes. The Covenant of workes is of juſtice, the Covenant of grace is of grace and mercy, which cannot agree and take place in one and the ſame ſubject: for he that try<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th juſtice, perceiveth not the force of mercy, <hi>&amp; è contra.</hi> This might be common to both Covenants, that God doth freely give reward, becauſe he was not bound unto it by any Law, and that is done of grace, which we are not tied unto by Law: but in the Covenant
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55916:13"/> of Grace, he gives the reward of meere and rich grace, and that to the creature which hath deſerved Hell.</p>
               <p>This Covenant entered immediately upon the fall, and ſo may be called a Covenant of Reconciliation, not of friendſhip. At the very inſtant, when God holy and true, was pronouncing judgements upon the ſeverall delinquents in the fall, ſetting downe his ſentence againſt the Tempter, both in his inſtrument the Serpent, and the maine Author Sathan, he brings in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty who ſhould execute the ſame, in which execution is unfolded the Covenant of grace for the Salvation of the creature, that the Serpent had deſtroyed, that God might be knowne in wrath to remember mercy. At the very fall, and before judgement was pronounced upon the delinquents that were tempted, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mercy was proclaimed, that by vertue of this Covenant God might prevent further waſte of his creature, which Sathan might haue wrought upon his new advantage in following his good ſucceſſe, and that the tempted might have ſome comfort before their judgement, leaſt they might have been ſwallowed up of wrath.</p>
               <p>The Authour of this Covenant is God, conſidered as a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and loving Father in Ieſus Chriſt: as a Creator he ſtrooke Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Adam</hi> in his integrity; as a Saviour he looked upon the poore creature plunged into ſinne, and miſery by reaſon of ſin.</p>
               <p>The cauſe that moved the Lord to make this Covenant, was not any worth, dignity or merit in man: for man never had ought, which he had not received; and now by his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had deſerved to be caſt off for ever: neither was the preſent miſery into which he had caſt himſelfe the cauſe that moved the Lord to receive man into favour: for the Angels more excellent by creation, as miſerable by their fall, he hath reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe: The ſole moving cauſe, why God made this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">Bonitatis Dei donumeſt, quod liberare nos vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit: quod verò aliter quam ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li modo libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nos noluit, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in thine owne blood, I ſaid unto thee, when thou wast in thy blood, live. Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. See <hi>Ezek. 36. 32. Luk.</hi> 1. 54, 55, 72, 78.</p>
               <p>This Covenant was made in Chriſt, in and through whom we are reconciled unto God: for ſince God and man were ſeparated
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55916:13"/> by ſinne, no Covenant can paſſe betwixt them, no reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be expected, no pardon obtained, but in and through a mediatour. Sinnes were never remitted unto any man, no man was ever adopted into the place and condition of a ſonne, by grace and adoption, but in him alone, who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, Jeſus Chriſt, true God and true man. <hi>Act. 4 12. Heb.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>The fall of our firſt parents was occaſion of this Covenant: for<note place="margin">Actus noſtrae liberationis di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinam bonita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem cauſam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.

Mercy freeing man from miſery poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble might have taken place before tranſgreſſion, and have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it ſelfe in the preventing of ſinne, and ſo of miſery: but it ſeemed good unto Almighty God to ſuffer miſery to enter upon man through ſinne, that he might make knowne the infinite ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his mercy, in ſuccouring and lifting him up, being fallen and plunged into a ſtate remedileſſe and deſperate for ought he knew. Beſides, we may conceive, that Almighty God, upon juſt grounds diſdaining, that ſuch a baſe creature falne by pride, ſhould thus upon advantage of the mutability of his reaſonable creature, ruinate the whole frame of the Creation, and trample the glory of his name under foot: and withall looking upon the Chaos which ſinne had brought, and would further make, if ſome ſpeedy remedy was not provided; did out of his infinite and boundleſſe love to man (though in the tranſgreſſion,) and juſt and dreadfull indignation againſt Sathan, give forth this gratious and free Covenant.</p>
               <p>The forme of this Covenant ſtands in gratious and free promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all good to be repaired, reſtored, augmented, and a reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ſuch duties as will ſtand with free grace and mercy. For the Covenant of Grace doth not exclude all conditions, but ſuch as will not ſtand with grace. The Covenant which was made of free love, when we lay wallowing in our blood, and which calls for nothing at our hands but what comes from, and ſhall be rewarded of meere grace, is a Covenant of grace, though it be conditionall. So the pardon of ſinne is given of grace, and not for workes, though pardon be granted only to the penitent, and faith on our part, a lively, unfained and working faith be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to receive the promiſe.</p>
               <p>The parties covenanting are two, and ſo are the parts of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55916:14"/> Covenant, the one in reſpect of God, the other in reſpect of man. A Covenant there is betwixt God and man, but no mutuall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of debt: for ſuch mutuall obligation is founded in ſome equality; but there is no equality between the Creator and the creature, much leſſe betwixt the Lord moſt high, and man a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If man had never offended, God almighty, who gave him his being and perfection, could not have been indepted unto him, but as he was pleaſed to recompence the good of obedience, in the creature that never deſerved puniſhment: much leſſe can God be indepted to the creature that hath offended, who can neither endure his preſence nor beare the weight of his wrath, nor ſatisfie Juſtice, nor deliver his ſoule from the thraldome of ſinne. The obligation of man to God is of double right and debt: but it is of rich grace and abundant love, that God doth bind himſelfe unto man. God doth promiſe in this Covenant to be God and Father by right of redemption, and Chriſt to be Saviour of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God by him, and in faith do yeild ſincere, uniforme, willing, upright and conſtant obedience unto his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32, 33 Deut. 31. 6. Ezek. 36. 25, 26. Gen. 15. 1, 4, 5. Jer. 32. 40. &amp; 33. 9. Heb. 8. 10, 11, 12. Iſa. 54. 7. Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>The ſtipulation required is, that we take God to be our God, that is, that we repent of our iniquities, believe the promiſes of mercy and embrace them with the whole heart, and yeeld love, feare, reverence, worſhip, and obedience unto him, according to the preſcript rule of his word. Repentance is called for in this Covenant, as it ſetteth forth the ſubject capable of Salvation by faith, but is it ſelfe only an acknowledgement of ſinne, no hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our wound, or cauſe of our acquittance. The feeling of<note place="margin">Luke 13. 5. Act. 11. 18. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Ezek. 18. 27<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hunger and thirſt make a man to deſire and ſeeke for food, but a man is not fed by being hungry. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance we know our ſelves, we feele our ſickneſſe, we hunger and thirſt after grace, but the hand which we ſtretch forth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, is faith alone, without which repentance is nothing but darkneſſe and deſpaire. Repentance is the condition of faith and the qualification of a perſon capable of Salvation: but faith alone is the cauſe of Juſtification and Salvation, on our part required. It is a penitent and petitioning faith, wherby we receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of mercy, but we are not juſtified partly by prayer, partly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55916:14"/> by repentance, and partly by faith, but by that faith, which ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up godly ſorrow for ſinne, and enforceth us to pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation. Faith is a neceſſary and lively inſtrument of Juſtification, which is amongſt the number of true cauſes, not being a cauſe without which the thing is not done, but a cauſe wherby it is done. The cauſe without which a thing is not done, is only preſent in the action, and doth nothing therein: But as the eye is an active inſtrument for ſeeing, and the care for hearing, ſo is faith alſo for juſtifying. If it be demanded whoſe inſtrument it is? It is the inſtrument of the Soule, wrought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the Holy Ghoſt, and is the free gift of God. In the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes, workes were required as the cauſe of life and happineſſe: but in the Covenant of grace, though repentance be neceſſary and muſt accompanie faith, yet not repentance, but faith only is the cauſe of life. The cauſe not efficient, as workes ſhould have been, if man had ſtood in the former Covenant, but inſtrumentall only: for it is impoſſible that Chriſt, the death and blood of Chriſt, and our faith ſhould be together the efficient or procuring cauſes of Juſtification or Salvation. When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Rom. 4. 2, 3.</note> writeth, that man is not juſtified by workes, or through workes, by the Law or through the Law (oppoſing faith and workes in the matter of Iuſtification, but not in reſpect of their preſence: faith, I ſay, and works, not faith and merits which could never be) without doubt he excludes the efficiency and force of the Law and workes in juſtifying: But the particles By and of doe not in the ſame ſenſe take Iuſtification from the Law and workes, in which they give it to faith. For faith only doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould and receive the promiſes of life and mercy, but the Law and works reſpect the Commandements, not the promiſes of meere grace. When therfore Iuſtification and life is ſaid to be by faith, it is manifeſtly ſignified, that faith receiving the promiſe, doth receive righteouſneſſe and life freely promiſed.

Faith that embraceth life is obedientiall, and fruitfull in all good workes: but in one ſort faith is the cauſe of obedience and good workes, and in another of Iuſtification and life eternall. Theſe it ſeeketh in the promiſes of the Covenant: thoſe it worketh and produceth, as the cauſe doth the effect. Faith was the efficient
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55916:15"/> cauſe of that pretious oblation in Abell, of reverence and preparing<note place="margin">Heb. 11, 4, 7, &amp;c.</note> the Arke in <hi>Noah,</hi> of obedience in <hi>Abraham:</hi> but it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument only of their juſtification. For it doth not juſtifie as it produceth good workes, but as it receiveth Chriſt, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive Chriſt, unleſſe it brings forth good workes. A diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to good workes is neceſſary to juſtification, being the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of an active and lively faith. Good works of all ſorts are neceſſary to our continuance in the ſtate of juſtification, and ſo to our finall abſolution, if God give opportunity: but they are not the cauſe of, but only a precedent qualification or condition to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall forgiveneſſe and eternall bliſſe. If then, when we ſpeake of the conditions of the Covenant of grace, by Condition we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand whatſoever is required on our part, as precedent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant or ſubſequent to juſtification, repentance, faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience are all conditions: but if by Condition we underſtand what is required on our part, as the cauſe of the good promiſed though only inſtrumentall, faith or beliefe in the promiſes of free mercy is the only Condition. Faith and workes are oppoſed in the matter of Juſtification and Salvation in the Covenant, not that they cannot ſtand together in the ſame ſubject, for they be inſeperably united, but becauſe they cannot concurre or meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in one &amp; the ſame Court, to the Iuſtification or Abſolution of Man. For in the Court of Iuſtice according to the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant either being juſt he is acquitted, or unjuſt he is condemned: But in the Court of Mercy, if thou receive the promiſe of pardon, which is done by a lively faith, thou art acquitted and ſet free, and accepted as juſt and righteous: but if thou believe not, thou art ſent over to the Court of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Obedience is two-fold, perfect in meaſure and degree, this is ſo farre required, that if it be not performed, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſinne in comming ſhort: And this God is pleaſed to exact at our hands, that we might walke in humility before him, ſtrive after perfection, and freely acknowledge his rich grace and mercy in accepting and rewarding the beſt ſervice we can tender unto his Highneſſe, when in the Court of Iuſtice it deſerveth to be rejected. 2. Sincere, uniforme and conſtant, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in meaſure and degree, and this is ſo neceſſary, that without it there is no Salvation to be expected. The Covenant of Grace calleth for perfection, accepteth ſincerity, God in mercy pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55916:15"/> the imperfections of our beſt performances. If perfection was rigidly exacted, no fleſh could be ſaved: if not at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, imperfection ſhould not be ſin, nor perfection to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured after. The faith that is lively to imbrace mercy is ever conjoyned with an unfained purpoſe to walke in all well pleaſing, and the ſincere performance of all holy obedience, as opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is offered, doth ever attend that faith, whereby we continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay hold upon the promiſes once embraced. Actuall good workes of all ſorts (though not perfect in degree) are neceſſary to the continuance of actuall juſtification, becauſe faith can no longer lay faithfull claime to the promiſes of life, then it doth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually or actually leade us forward in the way to Heaven. <hi>For if we ſay, we have fellowſhip with God and walke in darkneſſe, we lie and doe not the truth: But if we walke in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 6, 7. This walking in the light, as he is in the light, is that qualification, wherby we become imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly capable of Chriſts righteouſnes, or actuall participants of his propitiation, which is the ſole immediate cauſe of our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken for remiſſion of ſinnes, or actuall approbation with God. The truth of which Doctrine S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>In this Covenant man doth promiſe to repent of his ſinnes, and repenting to cleave unto the promiſe of mercy made in Ieſus Chriſt, and in ſaith to yeeld willing, cheerefull and continuall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.

Which muſt not ſo be underſtood, as if he that did of frailty and infirmity offend in any one jot or tittle, ſhould be held a Covenant breaker: for then no man ſhould be innocent, but the promiſe muſt be interpreted according as the Law or rule of obedience is given, which calleth for perfection but accepteth ſincerity. In the Covenant of mercy we bind our ſelves to believe and reſt upon God with the whole heart, ſo as doubting or diſtruſt of weakneſſe and infirmity, muſt be acknowledged a ſinne, but every ſuch frailty doth not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the perſon to be a tranſgreſſour of the Covenant. And the ſame holds true of obedience. But of this more largely in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular manner how God hath been pleaſed to adminiſter this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Man then doth promiſe to ſerve the Lord, and to cleave unto him alone, which is both a debt of duty, and ſpeciall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and he doth reſtipulate or humbly intreat, that God would be mindfull of his holy Covenant or teſtimony, that he would be his God, his Portion, his Protectour, and rich reward. Theſe things be ſo linked together in the Covenant, as that we muſt conceive the Promiſe of God in order of nature to goe before the Promiſe and obedience of man: and to be the ground of faith, whereby mercy promiſed is received. The offer of mercy is made to man an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever, that he might come home, and the promiſe muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before we can beleeve, elſe we ſhould beleeve we know not what, and faith ſhould hang in the aire without any founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55916:16"/> but mercy offered is embraced by faith, and vouchſafed to him that beleeveth. Alſo the duty which God calleth for, and man promiſeth, is mans duty but given of God. By grace man is enabled and effectually drawne to doe what God commandeth. The Covenant could not be of grace, nor the good things cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, if man by his own ſtrength did or could performe what God requireth.</p>
               <p>This Covenant was firſt publiſhed, and made knowne by lively voice: afterwards it was committed to writing, the tables there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being the holy Scripture. It was made both by word and<note place="margin">Pſal. 85. 4, 35. Deut. 29. 12, 14. Iſai. 54. 9. Heb. 6. 17, 18. Gen. 22. 16.

               <p>For manner of adminiſtration this Covenant is divers, as it pleaſed God in ſundry manners to diſpenſe it: but for ſubſtance it is one, the laſt, unchangeable and everlaſting.

In it God hath revealed his whole pleaſure touching the Salvation of man, and hath manifeſted his principall properties, the riches of his grace, wherein he delighteth to be magnified. He that is not ſaved by the Covenant of Grace, muſt and ſhall periſh everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Unchangeable and everlaſting: for therein God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe, in reſpect of the things he willeth concerning mans Salvation to be one and the ſame for ever.

The Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, is altered for our great good and comfort: but this Covenant is like the Covenant of the day<note place="margin">Iſai. 24. 5.

But ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, effectually, and in ſpeciall manner it is made only with them, who are partakers of the benefits promiſed. And as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is made outwardly or effectually, ſo ſome are the people of God externally, others internally and in truth. For they are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here it may ſuffice briefly to mention theſe things, becauſe in the ſundry manners of diſpenſation, they will come to be diſcuſſed more at large.</p>
               <p>From that which hath been ſaid two things may be gathered. 1. How the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> called by ſome Divines the Covenant of Nature, agreeth and differeth from the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>They agree in a generall conſideration of, 1. The Author, which is God only wiſe, moſt holy, our ſupreme and abſolute Soveraigne. 2. The matter of the Covenant, which is a Commandement and Promiſe of reward. 3. The perſons contracting or covenanting, which are God and man. 4. The Subject not differenced by ſpeciall reſpects, for the Law was given and Goſpell revealed to man. 5. The forme of adminiſtration, becauſe to both Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants is annexed a reſtipulation. 6. The end, <hi>viz.</hi> the bleſſedneſſe of man, and the glory of God manifeſted in his wiſdome, bounty and goodneſſe. 7. As <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency was
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55916:17"/> made able to fulfill the Covenant made with him: ſo is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace written in the hearts of them that be heires of the Promiſe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>They differ, 1. In the ſpeciall conſideration of the Authour, cauſe and foundation of the Covenants. God gave his Law to <hi>Adam</hi> as bountifull and gratious to his creature intire and perfect, but in ſtrict juſtice requiring obedience, promiſing a reward and denouncing puniſhment. But the Covenant of Grace he made as a loving Father in Jeſus Chriſt, of his meere Grace promiſing to receive them into favour, that ſincerely and unfainedly turne unto him. The Creation of man and integrity of humane nature, is the Foundation of the former Covenant: but the Redemption of man by Chriſt is the Foundation of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>2. In the forme of Sanction. In the Covenant of Nature there is no Mediatour: but the Covenant of Grace is made in Chriſt, in whom God hath made us accepted. The Covenant of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not promiſed before it was promulgated: but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace was firſt promiſed, and long after promulgated and eſtabliſhed or ratified in the bloud of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>3. In the ſpeciall matter of the Covenants, and that both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Promiſe and ſtipulation. For the Covenant of Nature promiſed life, but not righteouſneſſe: but in the Covenant of Grace God promiſeth to tread Satan under the feet, and to write his Law in the hearts of them that be heires of Salvation. That Covenant promiſeth life to them that perfectly obey, but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or forgiveneſſe of any, even the leaſt iniquity. But this promiſeth forgiveneſſe of ſinnes and life eternall to the penitent ſinner believing in Chriſt, and embracing the free promiſe of mercy. In that, life eternall is promiſed as the reward of juſtice: in this, life and glory as the reward of free and rich grace and mercy. To him that worketh, the wages is of debt; but to him that beleeves the reward is of Grace. In that God as a Creatour doth exact his right of man pure: but in this as a loving Father he doth offer himſelfe to the ſinner ſmitten with the conſcience of his ſinne. In that, life eternall and moſt bleſſed is promiſed, but only <hi>animal,</hi> to be enjoyed in Paradiſe, or continuance in that good eſtate wherein he was ſet at firſt of the rich bounty of God: but in the other, tranſlation out of ignominy and death into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe and glory in Heaven. In the Covenant of Nature
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55916:18"/> perfect obedience is exacted, ſo that if there be but the leaſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any jot or title, and that but once, a man can never be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, nor can the breach be made up by any repentance: But in the Covenant of Grace obedience is required, repentance admitted, and ſincerity accepted: If a man ſinne and goe aſtray, if he returne unfainedly, he ſhall be received into favour. In the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Nature obedience and workes were commanded as the cauſe of life and juſtification: in the Covenant of Grace, Faith is required as the inſtrumentall cauſe of Remiſſion and Salvation, obedience as the qualification of the party juſtified, and the way leading to everlaſting bleſſedneſſe. The object of obedience in the Covenant of Nature was God: in the Covenant of Grace God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. They differ in the ſpeciall conſideration of the Subject. The firſt Covenant was given to man pure, perfect, intire and ſound, able to do what God required: But the Covenant following was made with man a ſinner, miſerable and by nature the child of wrath. And ſo that was a Covenant of friendſhip, this of firme Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>5. In the ſpeciall and peculiar reſpect of the end. For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Covenant was made for the praiſe of Gods wiſdome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, bounty and juſtice. But the Covenant of Grace was made to declare and ſet forth the riches of Gods grace and mercy. In it the wiſdome, goodneſſe, power and juſtice of God is more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then in the former: and the mercy, long-ſuffering and rich grace of God is greatly magnified, which did not appeare or ſhine forth at all in the former.</p>
               <p>6. And in their Effects and Properties. For not the Covenant of Nature, but of Grace doth exclude boaſting. By the Covenant of Nature <hi>Adam</hi> was not advanced above the condition of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Servant. In the Covenant of Grace, man by nature the child of wrath, is made the child of God by grace and adoption. The Covenant of nature was neither the laſt nor everlaſting, but being firſt made way for a better, and being broken was antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſanulled to our ſingular comfort: but the Covenant of Grace ſhall continue firme and immoveable for evermore.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be gathered is, That the Fathers before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt, ever ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſtians in the times of the Goſpell, did live under the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55916:18"/> not for manner of adminiſtration, which is moſt cleare by evident<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8. Rev. 13. 8. Act. 4. 12. and 15. 11. Gal. 3. 29. Rom. 3. 30.

The ſame God that calleth us, called them to the hope of eternall life: they were endued with the ſame ſpirit, and lived by the ſame faith: Their Sacraments for ſubſtance in ſignification agree with ours: and they expected an Inheritance everlaſting and undefiled. Religion for ſubſtance was ever one and unchangeable, and ſuch as were truly religious walked in the ſame way, and waited for the ſame heavenly Inheritance and everlaſting crowne of glory. The Church before Chriſt may be conſidered as an heire, or as an Infant, according to the ſubſtance of the Covenant, or according to the manner of adminiſtration. In the firſt reſpect the Church is under the Covenant or Promiſe, and her people are called a free and willing people, an heire of heavenly and ſpirituall bleſſings. In the latter reſpect ſhe is under the Covenant, in reſpect of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent adminiſtration, and her people are called a ſervile people in compariſon, an heire under Tutors and Governors, not differing from a ſervant.</p>

And hence the Covenant of Grace is diſtributed into the Covenant of Promiſe, or the New Covenant, ſo called by way of excellency. For the Foundation and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the Covenant of Grace is our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but either to be incarnate, crucified, and raiſed from the dead, or as already<note place="margin">Act. 4 12. Heb. 13. 8.</note> incarnate, crucified, and truly raiſed from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven. For there was never ſin forgiven but in him alone, who is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though before the Incarnation, Chriſt was only God, he was our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55916:19"/> Mediatour, yet not ſimply as God, but as the divine perſon, who ſhould take our fleſh, and in it ſhould finiſh all the Myſterie of our Redemption, and therefore he is called the Lambe of God ſlaine from the beginning of the world, and the Fathers by his grace were ſaved, even as we. In the acts of Mediation three things may be conſidered. Reconciliation, by which we are accepted of God. Patronage, by which we have acceſſe unto the Father. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whereby God hath made himſelfe knowne unto men by a Mediatour. This third act might be done before he aſſumed our fleſh, and indeed was done: but the two firſt did require his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh, although the fruit of them was communicated to the Fathers under the Old Teſtament, by force of the divine Promiſe, and certainty of the thing to come with God.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, that the cauſe is before the effect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the incarnation and death of Chriſt muſt goe before the communication of the fruit and benefit thereof unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, That in naturall cauſes the Propoſition holds true, but in morall cauſes the effect may be before the cauſe: and ſo the fruit and vertue of Chriſts death was communicated to the Fathers before his Incarnation. But although the Sonne of God before he was manifeſted in the fleſh, was our Mediatour with God (to whom future things are preſent) becauſe he ſhould be, and therfore for his ſake ſinnes were remitted, men did teach and learne by his Spirit, the Church was governed by him: yet the manner and reaſon of that Mediation was propoſed more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the force and efficacy of it was leſſe, and did redound to few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>The end thereof is the praiſe of the glorious grace and mercy of God in Chriſt to come.</p>
               <p>In this Covenant there is a mutuall compact betwixt God and man: God in mercy promiſing, and man in duty binding himſelf unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>It was made with man a ſinner, and reacheth to the faithfull and their ſeed, as God hath promiſed to accept the children of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving parents, upon due and religious tender of them made unto his Highneſſe according as he hath preſcribed: but ſaving effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it was made with them only, who beleeve in him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly, be the heires of ſalvation, and walke in the ſteps of our Father <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>

The Sacraments of the Old Teſtament were not types of our Sacraments, as ſometimes they are called by Divines: but they typified the ſame things that ours doe.

               <p>Thirdly, that the faithfull before Chriſt were ſaved by the free mercy of God in Chriſt, did know God and Chriſt, had the<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9. Pſal. 105. 15. Iſai. 51. 6.</note> ſpirituall promiſe of life eternall, and were equall to us Chriſtians in all ſubſtantiall graces of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and from the ſame grounds we may conclude, that the ſoules of the faithfull, who departed this life before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt in the fleſh, were immediately received into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. For they were taken to glory, and ſaved as we: Now ſuch as are taken to glory, are taken to Heaven. For the Scripture know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Act. 15. 11.</note> no place in which God doth ordinarily diſplay his glory, but Heaven. And what ſhould hinder their tranſlation into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jeruſalem, when they are removed out of this earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle? Not their ſinnes, for they which could not hinder them from Sanctification, fitting them for Heaven, could not hinder them from Heaven: Not want of Faith, who now have that faith which <hi>Abraham,</hi> and many of them had: No want of efficacie in Chriſt, he was the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the world, he was yeſterday, to day, and for ever; his death was effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to cauſe them to find pardon, and the Spirit of Sanctification. Not any priviledge of Chriſt: for not ſimply to aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was Chriſts priviledge, but to aſcend ſoule and body, as heire
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55916:20"/> of all things, and the Authour of Salvation to all that obey him. <hi>David</hi> is ſaid not to have aſcended into Heaven, but that is ſpoken<note place="margin">Act. 2. 34.</note> in reſpect only that he was not raiſed in body, and gone into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven body and ſoule, as the heire of all things, and perſon who was to ſit at Gods right hand. It is alſo ſaid, <hi>The Fathers received</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>not the Promiſe, ſcil.</hi> of Chriſts comming in the fleſh to performe the worke of our Redemption: but as they received the promiſe of forgiveneſſe, and of the Spirit of Sanctification, ſo after their death they were taken into Heaven. They whoſe Pilgrimage and ſojourning ceaſed with this life, they could not but be in their Countrey at home after this life. But Heaven is the Countrey of the Saints; for where their Father is there is their Countrey. Thoſe who walked as ſtrangers here on earth, becauſe they looked<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13, 14, 15, 16. Heb. 11. 5. 2 King. 2. 11. Luke 9. 31.</note> for an heavenly Jeruſalem, a City whoſe Maker was God, they leaving this earth were tranſlated thither. The tranſlating of <hi>Enoch, Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> ſeeme to figure out no other thing. Chriſt was the fore-runner of <hi>Enoch,</hi> not in act, in reſpect of the aſſumption of his humanity into Heaven, but in vertue and merit. From the beginning of the world, a place was prepared for all, whom God had choſen in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31. and 20. 23. but a place was to be prepared of Chriſt, for us, in reſpect of the promiſed paiment, by the force and efficacy whereof the effect was before obtained, but with reſpect to future labours, which were both certaine and preſent with God. For a morall cauſe, though it be not preſent in act, if it be ſuppoſed as future, may have its effect. The faithfull before Chriſt, when they removed out of theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tabernacles, were received into everlaſting habitations. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 9. Now if the godly at the inſtant departed, were beſtowed in any place but Heaven, they then did goe to manſions, which they were to leave in a ſhort time, even then when Chriſt did aſcend. Our Saviour promiſed to the penitent Theefe upon the Croſſe, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> which if it was not<note place="margin">Luke 23. 43.</note> into Heaven, but into <hi>Limbus,</hi> it was but for a ſhort time; for that was to be broken up within a few houres ſpace.</p>
               <p>But to returne to the matter in hand, The Covenant of Promiſe and the new Covenant are ſo one for ſubſtance, that what is in the firſt for weight and eſſentiall, is in all the degrees following, and to be underſtood, though not mentioned, and whatſoever in any after degree appeares as ſubſtantiall to the Covenant, that was included
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55916:21"/> in the firſt propounding of it but in ſundry accidents, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder their ſubſtantiall unity, they are diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Firſt on the part of the Object, Chriſt exhibited in the New<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 1, 2. &amp; 4. 14. Mal. 3. 1. Iſai. 59. 15.</note> Covenant, is promiſed as to come in the Covenant of promiſe. For it was meete the promiſe ſhould goe before the Goſpell, and be fulfilled in the Goſpell, that ſo great a good might earneſtly be deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red before it was beſtowed, and that the expectation of them that waited for the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not be fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the manner of adminiſtration and meaſure of faith. For the knowledge of Chriſt, and faith in him to come, was more obſcure and darke, then the knowledge of him already come, and faith which doth behold him preſent. The manner of Chriſts Mediation was more ſparingly and obſcurely revealed: his perſon, the manner of execution of the office of Mediatour, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits that we receive in him, more darkly unfolded, ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in generall words, ſometimes ſhadowed in types and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, ſeldome more ſpecially deſcribed. And the reaſon why theſe things at firſt were more darkely delivered, may be: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things preſent or paſt are ſeene more clearely then things to<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 17.</note> come: propheſies be obſcure before the accompliſhment. 2. The Church was then in her Infancy and rude, not come to her ripe age, the Lord in his infinite wiſdome ſo diſpoſing the matter. 3. It was meete the cleare and full revelation of this myſtery ſhould be reſerved to Chriſt the chiefe Prophet. The Authour of life was to lay open and make manifeſt the way to life: Till the way into Heaven was really entred by the true high Prieſt, after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> it was not fully manifeſted: <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. Under the Old Teſtament the way into the Holieſt was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſhut, but vailed, not altogether untraced, but not fully laid open: becauſe our true and reall high Prieſt had not made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction by the offering up of himſelfe a ſacrifice once for all, nor conſecrated that new and living way through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh. 4. The minds of men were to be held in a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging deſire and expectation of Chriſt: and the obſcure revelation of Chriſt and his benefits did ſerve to raiſe their hearts to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire of his comming, in reſpect of the cleare revelation and great and glorious bleſſings they might then expect. But in this obſcurity we may obſerve ſome degrees: Before the Law given by <hi>Moſes</hi> the promiſe was more obſcure: the Law being given,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55916:21"/> even to the times of the Prophets leſſe cleare: in the times of the Prophets even to <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> more cleare. Even from the firſt giving forth of the promiſe untill the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh, the revelation was more cleare, diſtinct, ample, as the comming of the Meſſiah did approach neerer and neerer. For the Church by how much it was neerer to her beginnings, by ſo much it was the ruder, and therfore to be inſtructed in a more rude forme. As the time of the Sunne approacheth neerer, or if fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, ſo is the light that goeth before it, greater or leſſer: and as the time of the ariſing of the Sonne of righteouſneſſe is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote or nigh at hand, ſo was the revelation that went before more dimme or cleare. It was meete and expedient that when the comming of the glorious King of peace and righteouſneſſe did draw nigh, the hearts of men ſhould be raiſed up in deſire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of him: But the better they were acquainted with his perſon and office, the more diſtinctly they underſtood the time of his comming, the more lively taſt they had of the benefits they ſhould receive by him, and the greater tokens they ſaw of his glory approaching, the more their hearts would be enlarged to deſire and expect him. Moreover it was the good pleaſure of God to manifeſt the riches of his grace, not all at once, but by degrees, as he ſaw it moſt expedient for the glory of his great Name, and the good of his people in ſeverall ages and ſtates of the Church, of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake largely in the Chapters following. But here two things muſt be noted to prevent ſome doubts that may ariſe. Firſt that cleareneſſe of Revelation is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. One on the part of the revealer, when the revealer dealeth ſo, that unleſſe he have a rude hearer, or altogether malitious, it may be underſtood of the hearer what he meaneth. The other cleare, even on the part of the hearer, when it is ſo great that the rudeneſſe of the hearer cannot hinder, that he ſhould not perceive what is ſpoken, but his malice only. In the firſt ſence, the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſt in the Covenant of the promiſe was cleare: but the teſtimony concerning the Kingdome of Chriſt could not be underſtood of a rude hearer before the accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, how then could they be ſaved?</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is to be obſerved, that Chriſt doth not ſave as clearly knowne, but as he is ſincerely acknowledged. But when the Revelation was ſparing and darke, no man can deny that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55916:22"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:55916:22"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:55916:23"/> Chriſt was truly and unfainedly acknowledged in the Church of the Iewes. The word of God is the meaſure of faith, and that is true and ſaving faith, which believeth all things which are revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and in that manner wherein they are revealed, and therefore the faith of the Fathers was ſound and effectuall, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what God was pleaſed to reveale, and after that manner wherein it was revealed of God.</p>
               <p>A Third difference ariſeth from this; for Chriſt with all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits was propoſed to the Iſraelites under types and figures. As<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 7. 8. Heb. 10. 1, Gal. 3. 16. Heb. 8. 1, 2 &amp; 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Rom. 3, 25. 1 Iohn 2. 2. Heb. 3. 18. &amp; 4. 1.</note> the Prtieſts, Altars, Sacrifices, Propitiatory, were all types of Chriſt his Prieſt-hood and Sacrifice: and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> a type of Heaven: the Lord leading the Iewes by the help of earthly things to heavenly and ſpirituall, becauſe they were but young and tender: which was one cauſe why the Covenant was more obſcure, heavenly things being wrapt up under earthly. But in the new Covenant Chriſt is offered to be ſeene with open face; the truth, ſubſtance and body of the things themſelves is exhibited; and all vaile of figures removed, our minds are ſtreight directed to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>4. The variety of adminiſtration doth offer a fourth difference:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 12. &amp; 3. 13, 25.</note> for the Apoſtle compares the Nation of the Iewes to an heire as yet an Infant, that is under Tutours and Governours. The Chriſtian Church to an heire come to ripe yeares.</p>
               <p>And from this ariſeth a fifth difference, That as an heire not<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> come to yeares, not differing from a ſervant, the Church was held under the Ceremoniall Law, from which they that believe in Chriſt are delivered after the expiration of the time of nourture appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Father.</p>
               <p>Sixthly they differ in the number of them that are called to the participation of the Covenant. The Covenant of promiſe was at<note place="margin">Deut. 30. 8. Math. 10. 1, 6. &amp; 15. 24.</note> first concluded within the Families of the Patriarkes, the reſt having excommunicated themſelves, and then within the confines or limits of Iudea: that in the Iewes there might be a moſt illuſtrious type of Election, and of rejection in the Gentiles, that is, of the Church of God and Sathan. But the partition wall betwixt Iew &amp; Gentile being broken downe, the Covenant of grace was made with all Nations.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, the efficacy of Chriſt promiſed is leſſer then of Chriſt<note place="margin">Gen. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 18. Deut. 19. 8, 9.</note> exhibited. In the Covenant of promiſe, certaine promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55916:23"/> corporall bleſſings, were made unto the Fathers: and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall bleſſings were more eſteemed, as Symbols of ſpirituall and heavenly: But under the New Covenant, bleſſings ſpirituall, and the gifts and graces of the Spirit are in more ample and plentifull manner powred upon the Church. Remiſſion of ſinnes though it was certaine with God, was leſſe felt under the Covenant of Promiſe, becauſe the cloud of the Law put betwixt the mercy of God and the eye of the ſould; the grace of God was more obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed, and the meanes of expiating ſinne by the death of Chriſt; as alſo becauſe remiſſion of ſinnes was not really obtained by our ſurety, for as yet he had not made the ſatisfaction promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The Spirit was powred in leſſe plenty upon the faithfull: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">Ioh 3. 34. Ioh. 1. 16. &amp; 7. 38, 39. Ioel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 28.</note> that benefit was to be reſerved to the times of Chriſt, who was first to receive the Spirit above meaſure in his humane nature, and thence to derive grace unto all us. The Iewes as heires were partakers of the Spirit of Adoption, bu tempered with the ſprit of Servitude, becauſe they were Infants, under the yoke of the Law,<note place="margin">Rom 8. 15. Gal 46.</note> the way to heaven not as yet clearely manifeſted: But the heire come to ripe yeares, is altogether led by the Spirit of Adoption. The ſenſe of future glory was also more obſcure, becauſe there is more obſcure mention of it, and of the way thereunto in the Old Teſtament. If we ſpeake of ſome particular perſons under the firſt Covenant, they were endued with greater gifts of the Spirit then many under the New: but more light of knowledge, and greater plenty and abundance of Grace is beſtowed upon the Church in the time of the Goſpell, if we reſpect the body of the Church and faithfull in Generall.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, the ſeales of the Covenant of promiſe were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more, in ſignification more obſcure, in uſe painfull and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, peculiar to ſome people as the Covenant was, and to continue only untill the time of reformation: But the ſeales of the New Teſtament are in number few, in ſignification cleare, in uſe eaſy, common to all nations, and to endure for ever.</p>
               <p>And from theſe grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it may be concluded, That though the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being delivered from the Tabernacle of the body, were made<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6. &amp; 10: 20.</note> partakers of life eternall in Heaven. yet they had not before Chriſt that perfect ſtate in Heaven, which now we and they are preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed of: for they were not to be perfected without us, as neither ſhall we be perfected before that bleſſed day of the ſecond<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 39, 40.</note> comming
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55916:24"/> of Chriſt, wherein the body of Chriſt, that is, the Church, ſhall be abſolute and perfect every way. Not to inſiſt upon this, that the former Tabernacle ſtanding, the way to the Holieſt was not fully manifeſted, and that there muſt be ſome proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the manifeſtation of the way unto and ſenſe of the future life, in this life, in them that be of ripe age, and the fruition of it in the life to come: This is certaine, the Fathers who died before Chriſt, did expect in Heaven their Redeemer, on whom they had beleeved for forgiveneſſe of ſinne and life everlaſting: even as ſoules now expect the Reſurrection of the body, the ſecond appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt to Judgement, in regard of which things they are not perfected. Now hence followed a want of much light and joy, which on the ſight of Chriſt, God man, entring the Heavens, did redound unto them: as we in earth now have not the fulneſſe of joy which then we ſhall have, when we ſhall ſee the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of what we expect.</p>

               <p>Theſe words doe containe a manifeſt diſtinction betwixt the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the Serpent, and a promiſe of aſſured victory to the ſeed of the woman over Sathan, and all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall enemies to be adminiſtred according to the decree of God.

Alſo from the beginning is as much as from the beginning of the world, from the foundation of the world, or at leaſt, little after the beginning of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 44. the devill is ſaid to be a murderer from the beginning, and to ſinne from the beginning. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 8. The word beginning abſolutely and preciſely put, is taken one of theſe wayes, but with an addition or reſtraint from the circumſtances of the Text, it imports ſome other beginning, as of the preaching of the Goſpell, to this or that place or people, or the like; as <hi>Phil. 4. 15. 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 23, 24. But this phraſe from the beginning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imports from eternity, in any paſſage of Scripture: and it is ſomewhat ſtrange to interpret the beginning of duration by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which is eſſentially and abſolutely without beginning of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now when the Apoſtle ſaith, God hath choſen the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians from the beginning, what can we underſtand thereby, but God hath manifeſted ſome outward declaration of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, according to this famous promiſe made to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that the ſeed of the woman ſhould breake the Serpents head. Some would referre it to the time that the Goſpell was preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, or to the time of their effectuall calling: but the word <hi>beginning</hi> preciſely and abſolutely put is never ſo taken: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be ſaid, that the Theſſalonians were choſen as ſoon as the Goſpell was firſt preached unto them: for it may well be, that it was often preached unto them before they believed: nor from the beginning of their effectuall calling, if (as they would have it) the faithfull perſevering, not ſimply the faithfull, be the object of Gods Election. Of the other Texts alleadged the ſame may be ſaid, unto which the foreſaid anſwer can in no ſort be fitted: ſo that we may conclude, in all the fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cited paſſages there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant alluſion to this grand, ancient promiſe of mercy prclaimed immediately upon the fall, ſetting forth a manifeſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the Serpent, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of God. Beſides, in theſe words is implyed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55916:27"/> a Covenant conſiſting of a promiſe and ſtipulation, made not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally alone with the heires of promiſe, but externally admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, offered unto and accepted of all the members of the Church, viz. of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all their poſterity, that were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God by them, or did accept or receive the promiſe of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                  <hi>well ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> which is a promiſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that tooke place after the fall; for the former Covenant made no mention of mercy to be vouchſafed to the delinquent upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor of acceptance after tranſgreſſion. Of this Covenant there be two parts; firſt a promiſe, 2. a ſtipulation. The promiſe is, that God will pardon the ſinnes of them that repent unfainedly, and believe in his mercy: which he doth truly promiſe to all in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and effectually beſtow upon them that be heires of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. 2. The ſtipulation is, that they believe in him that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ungodly, and walke before him in all wel-pleaſing. This may be gathered, becauſe the promiſe of forgiveneſſe cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but by faith, and by faith it is that we overcome the world, and vanquiſh Sathan, the enemy of our ſoules. Thus we reade, that <hi>by faith the Elders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obtained a good report:</hi> and that <hi>by faith</hi>

And ſeeing it is the property of faith to worke by love, and to be fruitfull in all good workes, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity if faith be commanded, obedience is required, though not as the cauſe of life, yet as the way to life, and the fruit of faith. If we muſt beleeve in God, we muſt alſo walke with God, and worke righteouſneſſe. To whom God gives to believe in him, to them he gives to obey, and doe all his Commandements; as he doth to all that be effectually and internally in Covenant with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55916:28"/> his Highneſſe: and of whom he requireth faith in his Promiſe, of them he exacteth obedience to his Commandement, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of all them that be outwardly in Covenant. Thus we find, that by faith <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or walked before God in all well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing. <hi>Heb. 11. 5. 6. Gen.</hi> 5. 22, 24. And to what end is remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from ſinne promiſed, that man ſet free from the curſe of the Law and ſtroke of revenging juſtice ſhould wallow in profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? No, but that he ſhould ſerve God in holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe all the dayes of his life.</p>
               <p>But how doth God require theſe things at the hand of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature fallen, unleſſe he give them ſufficient grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve if they will?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is, man in the ſtate of Innocency, being made after the Image of God, had power both to beleeve and obey, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt by ſinne, God is not bound to repaire. And though he had not juſtifying faith, becauſe it argueth imperfection and ſinne, and could not looſe what he had not: yet by tranſgreſſion he brought himſelfe into ſuch a ſtate of bondage and wrath, which could not be removed but by faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. When God in juſtice doth ſhut men up in ignorance and unbeliefe, and with-hold from them both the graces of his Spirit, and the meanes thereof, his judgements are juſt, though ſecret. And if for the ſinne of man, God may juſtly caſt off millions, and not vouchſafe ſo much as outward meanes of Salvation unto them; he may alſo exact faith and obedience upon promiſe of pardon and eternall happineſſe, when he doth not deliver them from thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and bondage ſpirituall whereunto they plunged themſelves.

               <p>3. God doth deny nothing to them that be outwardly in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with his Highneſſe, that he is bound to give either in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or by promiſe, ſo that it will be in vaine for them to plead with God: for if they come ſhort of mercy promiſed, it is through their own wilfull neglect or contempt.</p>
               <p>4. No man is hindred from beleeving through the difficulty or unreaſonableneſſe of the command, or through his owne ſimple infirmity, as being willing and deſirous to beleeve, but not able, which inability deſerves pitty: but his inability is of corruption
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55916:28"/> and wilfulneſſe: he doth not beleeve, becauſe he will not, he is unable, becauſe he doth not covet or deſire, which is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</p>
               <p>5. His inability to beleeve is joyned with the wilfull refuſall of mercy promiſed and voluntary purſute of ſome inferiour good, as more to be deſired then Gods favour. But of this more in the next degrees of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Under this Covenant outwardly adminiſtred, were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended both <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, even ſo many as he ſhould dedicate unto God, or ſhould accept of the Covenant, untill by wilfull departure from the faith and worſhip of God they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted themſelves, and their poſterity.

What a faithfull ſervant doth on earth, which he cannot doe but by command and appointment of his Maſter, for that, if he doe it, we preſume he hath the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Maſter, although he doe not ſay ſo. But <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> faithfull Servants of God, offered ſacrifice, which they could not well doe, but by the Commandement of God: therefore they were ſo commanded, though ſo much be not expreſſed. All Ceremonies which ſignifie grace are ordained of God, or they be unlawfull. But the Sacrifices were Ceremonies which ſignified grace. It is written of <hi>Abel,</hi> that <hi>by faith</hi> he <hi>offered a better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice then Cain,</hi> and that <hi>God had respect unto Abel and his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> Of the ſacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>God ſmelled a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of rest:</hi> but in faith the ſacrifice could not have been offered, if it had not been preſcribed: it ſhould not have been accepted, if it had not carried the ſtamp of God. For thoſe Sacrifices were the types of Chriſt, and ſeales of propitiation and remiſſion of ſinnes in and through the bloud of Jeſus: which muſt be perſcribed, or they cannot be accepted. Theſe Sacrifices then were inſtituted of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55916:29"/> God, and may well be called ſeales of the Covenant, as they did ſignifie remiſſion of ſins in and through the bloud of Chriſt, our true Prieſt and Sacrifice. Whether God was pleaſed to confirme his Covenant by any other viſible ſignes or ſeales, in that ſtate of the Church, is more then the Scripture hath revealed.</p>
               <p>One queſtion remaineth to be diſcuſſed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Whether this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Promiſe was made in <hi>Adam</hi> with all and every Infant that ſhould afterwards be born into the world?</p>
               <p>There be ſome that hold the affirmative part, <hi>viz.</hi> That all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whether borne of beleeving, or infidell parents, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the Covenant of Grace, according to the internall efficacy, though not according to the externall adminiſtration, ſo as they be truly and effectually partakers of the benefits promiſed therein. But the Authors of this opinion doe neither conſent with themſelves in this, nor with the truth. Not with themſelves: for they ſay Chriſt died for all men conſidered in the common lapſe or maſſe, in reſpect of impetration, not of application. But if all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants be partakers of the Benefits of Chriſt, he died for them, and ſo for all men in reſpect of application: all men are effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, juſtified, ſanctified and adopted, untill by diſobedience they fall from that eſtate. Againe they confeſſe, that God with the Fathers may and hath reprobated the children, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to this aſſertion. <hi>Arm. in Perk. pag. 92.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55916:29"/> the ſtate of grace, and made partakers of the benefits of Chriſts death. It is contrary to the truth. For no ſuch thing can be found in the Scripture. In this firſt promiſe we find a manifeſt diſtinction betwixt the ſeed of the woman, and the ſeed of the Serpent: but that all Infants be of the ſeed of the woman, that we reade not: and therefore we cannot receive it. And when we ſee by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that many thouſands are excluded from the externall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and God hath left them without all meanes, whereby they ſhould come to the knowledge of Chriſt if they live, we cannot thinke all Infants effectually to be comprehended within the Covenant, and to be partakers of the good things promiſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. We know God is not tied to the meanes, nor doe we abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude every particular man from the grace of the Covenant, who is excluded from the Covenant outwardly adminiſtred: but we cannot thinke, they ſhould univerſally be partakers of the grace of the Covenant, who are rejected and caſt off in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall pledges and adminiſtration. And if all Infants be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the benefits of the Covenant, it is a wonder the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doe ſeldome or never ſhew themſelves in them that live; or that God ſhould leave them in ſuch condition, as if they live, it is ten thouſand to one, being deſtitute of all meanes to bring them to the knowledge of Chriſt, they ſhall fall from the grace received, and ſo plunge themſelves into eternall perdition. Whether this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will ſtand with the tenour of the Covenant as it was renewed and further manifeſted to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Iſraelites after him, we ſhall have occaſion to conſider in the Chapters following.</p>

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpend many Chapters in opening the ſpeciall paſſages of this grand contract betwixt God and <hi>Abraham.</hi> At the firſt breaking forth of the Covenant, it was propounded in dark and cloudie termes, not eaſie to be underſtood, and moſt things ſparingly expreſſed, and indeed rather implyed then expreſſed: In this ſecond riſe and further manifeſtation of the Covenant, we have it laid downe in a plaine and conceiveable language to all whom it concernes. <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will eſtabliſh my Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting Covenant:</hi> and it is fully expreſſed both in reſpect of the Head and Purchaſer or Undertaker, the confederates in this Covenant, and ſubfederates, the good things promiſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions required therein. That place of <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. is ſeldome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in holy writ, but now and then by way of alluſion: but thoſe of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed often preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the perſon of Chriſt, not only as Meritor of the Promiſe, and Satisfier of revenging wrath, nor yet as Maker of the Promiſes, nor only as Ratifier of the Promiſes by his death, nor as having the prime part in the Promiſes as man and Head, but as Treaſurer of them for the whole ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For <hi>all the Promiſes of God in him are Yea and Amen, to the glory of God by us. 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 20.

               <p>The Head upon whom this Covenant is ſetled, both as Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker and Confirmer, Purchaſer and Treaſurer of all good things promiſed therein, is Jeſus Chriſt: which is more fully expreſſed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55916:30"/> and often repeated in this ſecond breaking forth of the Covenant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 3, 4. and 18. 18. and 22. 18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> which cannot be underſtood of the ſeed collectively but ſingularly, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſſely proveth, ſaying, <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed was the promiſe</hi>

                  <hi>Abraham might come on the Gentiles.</hi> Some anſwer, that this is thrice put on in the paſſage of this Covenant with <hi>Abraham;</hi> firſt, in the federall confirmation by the figments with the ſmoaking fornace, and burning lamps, which paſſed between thoſe pieces, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 8, 9, 17. which howſoever it typified the dividing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed in Egypt with their fiery labours and ſorrowes: yet primarily the type expreſſeth the torment and rending of Chriſt <hi>Abraham</hi> his prime ſeed, and by the fornace and fiery lampe, the wrath of God that runneth betwixt, and yet did not conſume the rent and torne nature. Secondly, they conceive this perpeſſion of Chriſt was expreſſed in the bloud of the Circumciſion. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10, 11. For they be of opinion, that where God commands ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of bloud in any his ancient Ordinances, it doth fully reach unto the bloud of Chriſt, and his everlaſting Teſtament. The bloud which was ſhed in the ſignes ordained to ſeale the Covenant of Promiſe, what did it ſignifie but the bloud of Chriſt, whereby the Covenant was to be ſealed. Laſtly, we may find a full expreſſion of his paſſion in the reſolved ſacrifice of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which was typicall the death of Chriſt, and the Ramme in his ſtead: wherein is ſet forth an Embleme of Gods love unto the world, in that he hath truly ſacrificed his only Sonne Chriſt to take away ſinne. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.

                  </hi> and therefore indeed and truth they were not the ſeed. And the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Jewes, who had put Chriſt to death, ſaith, <hi>Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant, which God made with</hi>

                  <hi>our Fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, And in thy ſeed ſhall all the Kinreds of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Further it is to be obſerved, that in all the ſeed the Covenant reacheth to Infants borne of the ſeed under the Covenant, which was the reaſon why they muſt receive the ſeale of the Covenant at eight dayes old. Neither muſt we put off this, that Infants have only <hi>jus foederis,</hi> for they be <hi>foederati. Your children are holy,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. Holy by Covenant, though by nature ſinfull. Indeed it is true they be not capable of many actuall injoyments under the Covenant, nor of actuall Faith: but through the free grace and acceptation of God, the Promiſe of forgiveneſſe, and the Kingdome of Heaven belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth unto them. So that if any perſon come into Covenant and procreate children, that man and his iſſue are <hi>foederati,</hi> and may grow up into a further body from that beginning. From this we may ſee the true ground of all Covenants as they receive difference<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 9.</note> from the parties injoying, whether perſonall, family-Covenants, or nationall. Perſonall is the cauſe of family-Covenants, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Covenant, the ground of his Families entrance: and ſo the Covenant made with the Family the ground of nationall, as in the Families of <hi>Jacob</hi> caſt together, made all Iſrael under Covenant.

                  <hi>not dealt with us after our ſinnes, nor rewarded us after our iniquities. Deale bountifully with thy ſervant.</hi> And if a benefit freely vouchſafed be called a retribution, the retribution promiſed and of grace conferred upon the workers of righteouſneſſe, doth not inferre dignity or worth in the work rewarded. For when God doth performe his promiſe of meere grace, he is ſaid to retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, not that he oweth any thing to any man, or that he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any that hath the reaſon of a benefit, but becauſe he doth good unto them according as of his rich grace he was pleaſed to promiſe. And if God be ſaid to render or repay a reward, thence it will not follow, that good works can merit ought at the hands of God: for the word is of farre larger ſignification, and imports no more ſometimes, but to reſtore to one, that which was his own before; as <hi>Matth. 22. 21.

Numb. 3. 3. &amp; 36. 2. 2 Chron.</hi> 6. 23. where the Hebrew hath nothing but give, the Septuagint tranſlate it render or repay. Moreover, it ſignifieth to repay according to vow or promiſe, as is to be ſeen in many places of Scripture: <hi>Deut. 23. 21. Pſal. 22. 26. Pſal. 50. 14. &amp; 116. 12, 17. Hoſ. 14. 2. Joh. 2. 10.

Jer. 32. 18. Exod.</hi> 22. 5, 6. and there is a retribution of grace and bounty, which is of favour according to promiſe, as <hi>Ruth. 2. 12. Prov.</hi> 13. 21. and 25. 22. not to adde, that he that firſt doth good or evill, is ſaid to retribute; <hi>Pſal. 137. 8. Pſal.</hi> 35. 12. So that if God be ſaid to render or retribute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our righteouſneſſe, it is not in reſpect of the worthineſſe of our deeds, as if they deſerved it, but of his free promiſe and rich mercy, whereby he hath bound himſelf to accept of our ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and graciouſly to reward it.</p>
               <p>As God was pleaſed freely to make theſe promiſes to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſo alſo to confirme the ſame unto him by Oath. <hi>By my ſelfe have I ſworne ſaith the Lord. Wherein God willing more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55916:35"/> to ſhew unto the heires of Promiſe the immutability of his counſell, confirmed it by an Oath; that by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us. Abraham</hi> was ſtrong in faith, yet was it not ſuperfluous or altogether needleſſe, that God of his ſuperaboundant love and mercy, ſhould adde his Oath to the former promiſe, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſetling and aſſurance of his ſervant. Here that common ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be of uſe, <hi>Aboundant cautelouſneſſe doth not hurt,</hi> nay, it is of great profit and behoofe. But this is to be further noted, that God had reſpect to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> For <hi>Iſaack</hi> was preſent then, to whom the promiſes were confirmed in his father: which, when both the one and the other, ought to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to their poſterity, it was a matter of no light moment, that they might holily affirme, that God hath confirmed them both by word and Oath.</p>
               <p>In this paſſage, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 6. Rom. 4. 3. Gal. 3. 6. Jam. 2. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>him for righteouſneſſe,</hi> both the ſpirituall good things promiſed on Gods part in the Covenant, and the condition required on mans part, are implied. For the Apoſtle hence concludes, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was freely juſtified by grace through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus: and in this is included all eternall and ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, which doe accompany each other. For whom God doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, them he glorifieth. In the firſt expreſſion, the thing required on our parts was obſcurely implied, and we had much to doe to find it out: but in this paſſage it lieth bare. <hi>Abraham believed, &amp;c.</hi> This condition in <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Apoſtle fully followeth againſt the Juſticiaries of his and our times, oppoſing it to the condition of works in attaining the bleſſings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proving that this faith made <hi>Abraham</hi> the friend of God, and a juſtified perſon, having nothing to glory in this kind before God, from any worke. But ſeeing this text is ſo oft alleadged and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Apoſtles, and ſo much controverted among men, it is not amiſſe to handle the words more at large. In the Originall word for word they run thus, <hi>He beleeved the Lord,</hi> or in the Lord, <hi>and he imputed that to him righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Sptuagint render it, and the Apoſtles alleadge it thus, <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe:</hi> The word, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> imports, he thought the words of God to be ſure, certaine,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55916:36"/> ſtable and conſtant: and ſignifieth ſuch a beliefe, as is oppoſed to fainting: as it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob;</hi> when he heard the report of his ſons that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, <hi>his heart fainted,</hi> becauſe he believed not: but when he believed, his heart revived. <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 25, 26. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I had fainted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſſe I had beleeved,</hi> Pſal. 27. 13. So that it is a lively motion of the heart or ſoule aſſenting unto, and truſting in the word of God as firme and ſtedfaſt. Now whether you reade the word following, in or upon God, as <hi>Arias</hi> and <hi>Pagnine,</hi> or God, as the Apoſtles alleadge it; it is all one: for here to believe God, as all circumſtances doe ſhew, is to put truſt and confidence in God, or with lively adherence to ſticke or cleave<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 24.</note> unto the word of God. <hi>And he imputed, ſc.</hi> God, or he in whom <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, as the conſtruction it ſelfe and words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifeſtly convince: or, it was imputed, as <note n="a" place="margin">Iſa. 22. 8.

               <p>The imputation of a good thing is done three wayes, by right, grace and injuſtice: becauſe law, juſtice and right is oppoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and grace. But here it muſt be noted, that its one thing to ſay a man is reputed juſt, another to ſay, this or that thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for righteouſneſſe: a man is reputed juſt, but not imputed juſt; reputation is ſpoken of the concrete, imputation of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract: imputation is the cauſe, reputation the effect: Imputation by debt or right is, when that which is inherent in the ſubject, or due to it, is imputed, as wages counted of debt to him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. But many things due cannot be ſaid to be imputed, unleſſe the word imputation be taken improperly for giving or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement; as we ſhould improperly be ſaid to impute glory to God for to give or acknowledge. Imputation by injuſtice is, when righteouſneſſe of quality or fact is imputed to an unjuſt man, and he is acquitted contrary to law. Imputation by grace, when righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is imputed to them that be unjuſt in themſelves, and the guilty is acquitted, not of debt, but of grace, yet not againſt juſtice, but upon juſt and equall conſiderations. Righteouſneſſe alſo is put either for ſome one individuall righteous act, done after a manner pleaſing and acceptable unto God, which is called the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fact, or it is put for univerſall righteouſneſſe, which is either the matter of juſtification, or at leaſt the thing required on our part to juſtification, and is called the righteouſneſſe of the perſon: which latter is here to be underſtood, as is more at large to be ſhewed hereafter. Now from all that hath been ſpoken it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That perfect and ſtrict righteouſneſſe of quality or work in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, is and ought to be imputed of juſtice to the ſubject in whom it is: but by gracious eſtimation it cannot be imputed in the place or roome of righteouſneſſe inherent: for what is accounted by grace, that either is not in the ſubject, or it is not really that in the roome and ſteed whereof it is accounted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Works of righteouſneſſe done in faith after a manner plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and acceptable unto God, are of grace imputed to the doer for
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55916:37"/> juſt and righteous actions, the imperfections that cleave unto them being freely pardoned. Not that works are able to beare the exact triall of the Law, or can ſtand as the matter of juſtification before the Lord: but that God in Chriſt is pleaſed to accept of our works as good and pleaſant, our perſons being accepted in his beloved, and the weakneſſe of our works covered by his interceſſion. Thus <hi>Phinehas</hi> his executing of judgement was imputed to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 31.

               <p n="3">3.

For by faith alone in Chriſt, through the meere grace and mercy of God, we obtaine full pardon and remiſſion of all our ſins, and ſo our works come to be acceptable in Gods ſight.</p>

                  </note> whereunto it is imputed, ſo that imputation hath relation unto both. And to make this manifeſt, we may conſider theſe three phraſes. The firſt is, <hi>The obedience of Christ is imputed unto juſtification,</hi> conformable to that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>By the obedience of one man many are made righteous.</hi> The ſecond phraſe is, <hi>Faith is imputed unto righteouſneſſe.</hi> The third is, <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is imputed unto life.</hi> The equivalent whereof we have, <hi>Rom. 4. 11. &amp;</hi> 5. 17, 18. In the firſt phraſe imputation is betwixt Chriſts obedience, as the thing which is imputed, and juſtification as the end whereunto it is imputed, and it hath reference. In the ſecond phraſe, imputation commeth in betwixt faith, as the thing which is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55916:38"/> imputed, and righteouneſſe as the thing whereunto it is imputed. In the laſt phraſe, imputation commeth in betwixt righteouſneſſe it ſelfe as the thing imputed, and life as the end whereunto it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
               <p>This paſſage whereof we now ſpeake, is diverſly interpreted by Orthodox Divines, but all aiming at the ſame truth, and meeting in the maine, being rather ſeverall expreſſions of the ſame truth, then different interpretations. The firſt is, That faith is imputed unto righteouſneſſe, that the obedience of Chriſt apprehended by faith, may be righteouſneſſe unto the apprehender. For faith and beleeving ever implieth the poſſeſſion of Chriſt and his obedience in our hearts; and the imputation of faith unto righteouſneſſe, is the thing that makes Chriſt poſſeſſed by faith to be our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Chriſts obedience is righteouſneſſe in it ſelfe, ſo that it is neither our faith, nor Gods imputation of our faith, that makes his obedience to be righteouſneſſe: but imputation of faith to us as ours, maketh the obedience of Chriſt poſſeſſed by faith (being righteouſneſſe in it ſelfe) to be our righteouſneſſe. For as the making of that, whereby we obtaine poſſeſſion to be ours, maketh the thing poſſeſſed alſo to be ours: ſo that imputation of faith (which is a gift ſupernaturall and not within our power) maketh Chriſts obedience to be that unto us, which it is in itſelfe though it were never imputed unto us. And to confirme this expoſition, that of the Apoſtle is alleadged: <hi>With the heart man beleeveth</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10 10.</note> 
                  <hi>unto righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth he confeſſeth unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In which ſentence, the Greeke word which is rendred [<hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>] cannot be rendred [<hi>for</hi>] without darkning, if not perverting the true ſence and meaning of that place. For we are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with the heart unto righteouſneſſe, in the ſame ſence and meaning, wherein we are ſaid to confeſſe with the mouth unto ſalvation. Neither is there any reaſon why faith ſhould be ſaid to be imputed unto righteouſneſſe in any other ſence, as concerning the word [<hi>unto</hi>] then we are ſaid to believe unto righteouſneſſe: but in all reaſon the Greeke word which we render, <hi>unto,</hi> muſt in both theſe phraſes be taken in one and the ſame ſence: that is, as we believe with the heart, to this end that we might by faith (as the only apt and meete inſtrument, and only covenient and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall meane to apprehend and poſſeſſe) attaine to the poſſeſſion of the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt: even ſo the Lord our God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55916:38"/> imputeth faith to us as our own, to this end that the righteouſneſſe which we poſſeſſe by it, may make us righteous before him, or be righteouſneſſe unto us in his ſight.</p>
               <p>The ſecond expoſition is, that faith is graciouſly imputed, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned or eſteemed for righteouſneſſe, or in the place or ſteed of righteouſneſſe, becauſe the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is imputed to none but beleevers. For thoſe ſinners onely are juſtified before God, who (we ſpeake of them that live till they come to yeares of diſcretion) by a ſound and ſaving faith doe lay hold of, and rely<note place="margin">Quae ſemper tacentur nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam affirman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur: Quae affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantur, dum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liqua tacentur, ſola affirmantur.</note> upon Jeſus Chriſt, as he is ſet forth of God to be a propitiation. Hence it is, that the Covenant of Grace, in ſteed of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law required to legall Juſtification, which is wanting in us by reaſon of our ſins, exacteth no other thing inherent in us, as a cauſe of Juſtification, or condition in reſpect whereof we are juſtified, but faith alone. And thus in a fit ſence it may be ſaid, that faith is of grace accounted, in ſteed of legall righteouſneſſe: not that it is the meritorious or materiall cauſe of our Juſtification, as legall righteouſneſſe ſhould have been, if Juſtification had been by the Law, nor that it is accepted for the perfect righteouſneſſe of the Law: but becauſe it is the ſole inſtrumentall or conditionall cauſe, required on our part to Juſtification, in reſpect whereof we are acquitted from our ſins. For in the Covenant of workes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience is required at our hands to Juſtification: but in the<note place="margin">Reputare ſive imputare adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam, idem eſt, quod in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiae loco nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merare.</note> Covenant of Grace nothing but faith on our parts is called for, and that not as the forme or matter of Juſtification, but the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only, whereby we receive remiſſion of ſins, and are partakers of the merits of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The third Expoſition is, that when faith is imputed for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, it is not to be underſtood materially, as though the dignity, worth and perfection of faith made us juſt; but relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in reſpect of the object, that is, to us beleeving righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> of Chriſt is freely imputed, and by faith we receive righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and remiſſion of ſins freely given of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay faith juſtifieth, and faith is imputed for righteouſneſſe, are phraſes equivalent. For faith juſtifieth not by it's merit or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but as an inſtrument and correlatively, that is, the merit of Chriſt apprehended and received by faith juſtifieth, not faith whereby it is apprehended and received, unleſſe it be by an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech, wherein the act of the object, by reaſon of the neare
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55916:39"/> and ſtrict connexion betwixt them, is given to the inſtrument. And with this expoſition for ſubſtance of matter agreeth theirs, that make an Hypallage in theſe words; faith is imputed unto, or for righteouſneſſe, as if the ſence was this, righteouſneſſe is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto faith, or the faithfull are partakers of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. The thing queſtioned in theſe expoſitions is, whether the words muſt be taken tropically or properly: but the matter and ſubſtance of doctrine contained in them, is one and the ſame. For herein they all agree, that <hi>Abraham</hi> did beleeve the whole truth of God revealed, but his beleefe which was accepted for, or unto righteouſneſſe, did reſpect the promiſed ſeed. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved the power of God to performe whatſoever he promiſed; he beleeved whatſoever God plainly promiſed, and he beleeved what God promiſed though farre off, as the giving of the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but the principall thing promiſed was, that in his ſeed all Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, and belief in this promiſe was accepted for righteouſnes. All earthly promiſes made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> proceeded from the meer love and favor of God towards him, and many of them were types and figures of ſpirituall, ſo that in beleeving them, he muſt needs beleeve the promiſe of bleſſing in his ſeed, which is Chriſt. <hi>Abraham</hi> could beleeve no promiſe, but he muſt beleeve that God is the rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſeeke him: but he cannot beleeve in God, as the rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them that ſeek him, unleſſe he have an eye to the promiſed ſeed.</p>
               <p>The righteouſneſſe here mentioned is not the ſingular righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this or that act, whereby a man is ſaid to doe juſtly or righteouſly, which is called the righteouſneſſe of fact: but univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall righteouſneſſe or the righteouſneſſe of Juſtification, whereby a man is freely acquitted from all his ſins, and accepted of God as righteous unto life, which is called righteouſneſſe of the perſon. Faith is not imputed for righteouſneſſe, in reſpect of the worth or dignity of faith either in habit or act, but in reſpect of it's office, whereunto it is ordained in the Covenant of Grace, as it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, and thereby we are made partakers of the merits of his free and willing, and perfect obedience to the command of Grace. Faith is accounted for righteouſneſſe in regard of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and is a cauſe of that Juſtification which is of grace.

In which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon faith never hath the place of our righteouſneſſe, but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in our participation of righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, to that which is the ground of our being partakers in the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> For, as we were one with <hi>Adam,</hi> and in reſpect of orignall and nature were in him, and one with him, and ſo by being in him and one with him, did all in him and with him tranſgreſſe the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: even ſo, in reſpect of faith, whereby onely we are united unto Chriſt, and ſpiritually made one with him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him, we all in him did ſatisfie the juſtice of God, or are made partakers of the fruit and benefit of his ſatisfaction. Thus our union with Chriſt and meanes thereof, is alwaies to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from our communion with him, in the participation of his righteouſneſſe, as the fruit thereof. Like as our being in <hi>Adam,</hi> and one with him, is to be diſtinguiſhed from the fruit thereof, which is communion with him in the participation of his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.

But that they might not ſeeme directly to croſſe the Apoſtle, they ſay, we are not juſtified by the works of the Law, that is, exact and every way perfect, whereunto wages is due by debt; but by works of grace, graciouſly eſteemed for righteouſneſſe, when in the rigour of the Law it is not exact and perfect righteouſneſſe.</p>

And if God have not taught any ſuch manner of Juſtification, it is not for us to receive it. We reade of two waies of Juſtification, by faith and works: but of a third manner by faith and works, both as joynt cauſes or con-cauſes, we find nothing in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By the doctrine of faith we are bound to acknowledge and confeſſe that Chriſt Jeſus by his eternall Prieſt-hood, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſole meritorious cauſe of all grace or righteouſneſſe inherent, requiſite to finall abſolution: but theſe preſuppoſed in the party to be abſolved, he is likewiſe the ſole immediate cauſe of finall abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or juſtification. Without obſervation in ſome meaſure to all the Commandments of God, we cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: but we enter not for the obedience we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

Our imperfect
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55916:41"/> obedience then is not the immediate cauſe of our abſolution, but the obedience and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt. By the immediate and next cauſe we underſtand ſuch a cauſe as is neceſſarily accompanied by the effect, and without whoſe participation the effect never doth, nor can be-fall any: ſuch a cauſe as whoſoever is partaker of, is by participation of it, forth-with abſolved; ſuch a cauſe as who ſo can probably hope to be partaker of, he may upon the ſame degrees of probability hope for finall abſolution; ſuch a cauſe, as who ſo doubts or feares, leaſt he ſhall never be partaker of in this life, muſt upon the ſame termes doubt or deſpaire of his abſolution or ſalvation. But if workes be accounted for the exact righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law unto us, not the obedience of Chriſt received by faith, but the works of holineſſe in us, are the abſolute cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and acceptance unto life. And what elſe doe the words ſound, as they be interpreted, but, that as exact obedience to the Law, ſhould have been the matter or cauſe of Juſtification from juſtice, ſo ſincere obedience by the eſtimation of grace, is the matter of Juſtification by grace. They will ſay, I know, faith and workes are onely the condition without which remiſſion cannot be obtained: but faith is not a bare condition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the thing cannot be, (for that is no cauſe at all) but an inſtrumentall cauſe: and workes, if they be any cauſe of Juſtification, inſtrumentall they cannot be, but the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and for which we are juſtified or accounted righteous. Workes doe not embrace Chriſt, but if cauſes of Juſtification, they muſt challenge to themſelves: and therefore how faith and workes ſhould be conjoyned as con-cauſes in Juſtification it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to conceive, ſeeing the one, that is, faith attributes all<note place="margin">In eo q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For if works be accounted to us in the roome or place of exact obedience in free Juſtification, doe they not ſupply the place? are they not advanced to the dignity of works compleate and perfect in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from juſtice?</p>
               <p>3. If faith with workes be accepted for righteouſneſſe to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then faith juſtifieth not as it imbraceth the promiſes of mercy, and by it we partake in the merits of Chriſts death and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55916:41"/> obedience, but as it doth give aſſent to the truth of the Goſpell, and adhere and ſticke to the Commandements: for in that ſenſe it is an act or exerciſe commanded in the Goſpell, and not only as it doth receive Chriſt and the promiſe of forgiveneſſe. But in Scripture every where faith in Chriſt, in the Lord Jeſus, or the<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13. 1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> bloud of Chriſt is ſaid to juſtifie, not faith in other promiſes, threatnings, or Commandements.</p>
               <p>4. How can it be proved, that in the matter of Juſtification the Apoſtle doth oppoſe faith to workes exactly perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat only, and not to the workes of grace done according to the preſcription of the Law, as it was given to the Jewes to be a rule how people in Covenant ought to walke. <hi>To him that worketh</hi>

                  </note> (ſaith he) <hi>the wages is of debt:</hi> but he that worketh is not only perfectly juſt, but he that is mercenarie, that is, to him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for his reward, as if the reward ſhould be given him for his worke. For thus the Apoſtle argues, When wages is given to an hireling or mercenary, it is of debt. But Juſtification or life is not given of debt, but of grace. Therefore it is not given to him that worketh, or to the mercenary. Properly God oweth nothing to him that fulfilleth the Law either exactly or ſincerely, when they doe nothing but their duty, and there is no proportion betwixt God and them: but becauſe they ſeeke righteouſneſſe and life by workes, if God ſhould retribute to them a reward, he ſhould be thought to doe it, as it were of debt.</p>
               <p>The Law was given to be a rule of direction to them that be in Covenant: and workes of the Law are workes done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that preſcription: which the Apoſtle here excludes from being any cauſe of Juſtification, though he that walkes according to this Law, being not an hearer, but a doer of the Law, is bleſſed in his deed.

                     </gap>peris,</hi> but which is more of an ungodly man, to receive abſolution from the hand of grace by a true and lively faith. And faith is accounted for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by gracious acceptation: but what is accounted by free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that is not truly and really the thing it is accounted for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in us. It will be ſaid, Faith was not reputed to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, after that he excelled with many vertues ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving embraced Chriſt: But the holy Ghoſt rather teſtifies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the excellency of <hi>Abrahams</hi> vertue was great, whereby he had increaſed by long perſeverance, yet he was not otherwiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as righteous unto life, but becauſe by faith he received grace offered in the promiſe. The faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was great and excellent for degree and meaſure, but it was not accepted for righteouſneſſe in regard it was ſtrong and eminent: but becauſe it laid hold upon the promiſed feed. The faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> was eminent, but not perfect, and juſtified him not abſolutely as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55916:42"/> vertue, but relatively as it received the promiſe of mercy, not as if <hi>Abraham</hi> was thereby made perfect by inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for then <hi>Abraham</hi> had whereof to glory in himſelfe, but as in himſelfe a ſinner and ungodly he obtained free and full remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the meere grace and favour of God. So that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from this paſſage of holy writ, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith alone: but this his faith though alone in the act of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, no other grace coworking with it, was not alone in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, did not lie dead in him as a dormant and idle quality. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith is lively and operative, attended with every other grace of the Spirit, ſetting them upon their worke, animating and quickning them thereto, and regulating them therein. It ſtirres up ſorrow for ſinne, and purpoſe of amendment; it raiſeth the ſoule earneſtly to long after, and heartily to crave mercy: it comes to Chriſt as an humble, poore, penitent petitioner for forgiveneſſe: but that which is done by faith ſtirring up ſorrow, and working by prayer, is not done partly by faith, partly by ſorrow, and partly by prayers, but by that faith which doth enforce to pray. For faith leaneth upon the promiſe, and no promiſe is made, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of prayer being ſhut forth. <hi>Aske, and it ſhall be given you, Mark</hi> 11. 24. Therefore our Saviour Chriſt being intreated of many that he would heale them, attributeth all the force of their prayers to faith, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> And ſo by what faith <hi>Abraham</hi> embraced the promiſe, by the ſame he offered up his Son <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Workes then (or a purpoſe to walke with God) juſtifie as<note place="margin">Jam. 2. 22, 23.</note> the paſſive qualification of the ſubject capable of Juſtification, or as the qualification of that faith that juſtifieth; or as they teſtifie or give proofe that faith is lively: but faith alone juſtifieth, as it embraceth the promiſe of free forgiveneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith was accepted for righteouſneſſe, but <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 1.</note> is commanded to walke before God, and to be perfect.

But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this text be interpreted, the Apoſtle elſewhere manifeſtly confirmeth this point, ſhewing that ſome were perfect in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of others, who had not yet attained to perfection. Here it muſt be remembred, that howſoever the word perfect be referred to knowledge in the myſteries of Religion in the writings of the Apoſtles, yet it is not ſeldome referred to practice and manners. In the firſt reference, they are ſaid to be perfect, who have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned an high degree of knowledge in heavenly and divine myſteries: In the ſecond, they that teach in deed and fact that they have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what they profeſſe. <hi>Let patience have its perfect work,</hi> Jam. 1. 4. that is, let it ſhew its ſincerity and conſtancy in works, that not in words and geſtures, but in deed and truth it be approved; that it cannot be overcome in the greateſt evils, but doth hould out and remaine invincible.

Christ was made perfect through ſufferings,</hi> Heb. 2. 10. <hi>as he learned obedience by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> Heb. 5. 8. for there is an experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall learning. And to this purpoſe belongs that ſpeech of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours upon the croſſe, <hi>It is finiſhed:</hi> for hereby was ſignified, that he had fulfilled all things, which he was to doe upon earth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 32. and they that ſhed their bloud for Chriſts ſake and for the Goſpels are ſaid to be perfected. Thus the patient are called perfect, becauſe patience is a document of a mind moſt exerciſed in piety and godlineſſe. So the power of God is perfected in our weakeneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. for the vertue of Chriſt is not perfected in weakeneſſe as in the ſubject, not by infirmity as by the effect: but when it ſheweth it ſelfe in the greateſt and principall things. The power of God is not encreaſed, nor diminiſhed: but then it is ſaid to be perfected, when in the judgement of man it doth that which is moſt hard and difficult. For we live and die in God, and this is of the power of God: but when in the greateſt ſtreights, and even in death it ſelfe we live and breathe, the power of God doth after a ſpeciall manner ſhew forth it ſelfe, and is perfected in us, that is, doth ſhew it ſelfe to be exceeding great, which cannot be conquered or overcome. In the ſame manner as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Fath is perfected by works,</hi> Jam. 2. 21. not that works doe perfect faith, but that faith whileſt it brings forth good works, doth manifeſt how perfect it is: it borroweth not force from workes, but in works doth declare what force it hath. Thus the graces of the Spirit are perfected, whileſt by the effects it is made manifeſt how perfect they are.<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 7. Mat. 5. 48. Pſal 18. 30. Heb. 12. 23.</note>

               <p>3. That is perfect, which is every way abſolute and compleate, to which nothing is wanting, nothing ſuperfluous: and ſo the ſoules of the juſt are made perfect in Heaven. In the firſt degree perfection is neceſſary to ſalvation, without which we cannot be partakers of the eternall inheritance: in the ſecond and third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree it is to be ſtriven after, though the latter cannot be obtained in this life. The greateſt meaſure of perfection attaineable in this preſent life, is an imperfect perfection: but that imperfection is ſin; and therefore though we come ſhort, we muſt ſtrive forward towards perfection, that we might be perfect hereafter.</p>

               <p>Integrity is neceſſary, becauſe the moſt holy God will never give himſelfe to be poſſeſſed and enjoyed to a ſpirituall adultreſſe, who doth affect any other lover more, or beſides him. A woman<note place="margin">Rev. 14. 3, 4.</note> may have many friends, but one as an Husband: Conjugall love of it own nature, is of that kind, that it muſt be of one, and cannot be communicated to many. If God be wholly ours, we muſt be wholly his. And if we joyne ought with God, or take in ought with him, we doe not, we cannot cleave to him alone. When there are two objects upon which the heart is ſet, it is divided: and men of divided hearts, can have no fellowſhip or communion with him. We cannot ſerve God, unleſſe we ſerve him intirely: he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be our Maſter, if we have any other. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. God heares them that pray with their whole heart. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12, 13. is found of them that ſeeke him with their whole heart. <hi>Pſal. 119. 2. Deut.</hi> 4. 29, 30. takes pleaſure in them that be intire in their way. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 20. and accepts their work. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 11. If a Chriſtian be not intire, he can never be perfect in degree: for what is defective in parts, can never be made up by any growth. He can never come to be a perfect man in Jeſus Ceriſt, and every way compleate, in whom the work of grace is imperfect and maimed in the parts eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall or integrall. If a plant be imperfect, it will never be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tree: If a Child be borne maimed or imperfect, no growth of parts received can reſtore what is defective in nature: If a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian be ſanctified in mind only, or in ſome affection only, and not in every part, no growth in what he hath obtained, can ever make his ſanctification perfect and compleate. Integrity is the qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſubject capable of finall pardon, and eternall bleſſedneſſe through grace. Remiſſion of ſins is received by faith, but faith that embraceth pardon, doth unite and knit the ſoule inſeparably to God, and to the word of his grace, it ſeaſoneth every affection, and ſtirreth them up to their proper functions according as the word directeth. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered: Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth no ſin, and in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile.</hi>

                  <hi>David</hi> had many imperfections, and did often ſtep aſide in the way, but he is not accuſed to breake the whole Law in any thing, ſave in the matter of <hi>

Contrarily in <hi>Jehu,</hi> after a large deſcription of many excellent things, it is obſerved, <hi>But Jehu regarded not to walke in the Law of the Lord with all his heart;</hi> and ſo his ſervice in deſtroying <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe (rewarded with a temporall bleſſing<note place="margin">2 King. 10. 31. Hoſe 1. 4. 2 Chron. 30. 15, 19.</note> to the fourth generation) was reckoned murder. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is bould to pray in behalfe of them that came unprepared to the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>The good Lord be mercifull unto him that prepareth his heart to ſeeke the Lord God, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary.</hi> An Husband will beare with many aberrations in the behaviour of his Wife, ſo long as he is perſwaded of the intireneſſe of her heart towards him: and ſo dealeth the Lord with them that feare before him with all their hearts.

                  <hi>then he that is perverſe in his wayes,</hi> turning away now on this ſide, now on that, <hi>though he be rich.</hi> Integrity advanceth the poore man above the wealthy, and yeeldeth him more ſound com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and profit both, then all the riches in the world can. <hi>They are bleſſed that walke in the perfect way:</hi> Not they that walke in the way of the Miniſtery, or of the Magiſtracy, but indefinitely they which walke in any way allowable by the word, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, be it never ſo meane or ſimple, they are bleſſed. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the undefiled in the way,</hi> whatſoever it be, be it to be the ſcowrer of Channels, drudge in a Kitchen, or to ſerve in the Gallies.</p>
               <p>More particularly. <hi>The perfect ſhall not be confounded. Let my heart be intire in thy ſtatutes, that I be not aſhamed.

For<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 18.</note> as it is in the Pſalme, <hi>With the perfect man, thou wilt ſhew thy ſelfe perfect:</hi> thou wilt not faile him in his need. This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, that he frameth himſelfe to the diſpoſitions of men, good to the good, hard to the ſtubborne, intire to the perfect that waite upon him. <hi>The Lord knoweth the dayes of the perfect, and their inheritance ſhall be for ever:</hi> that is, he ſeeth to what evils they lie open, what help they need, and ordereth all events to their<note place="margin">Prov. 28. 16. &amp; 10 9, 29.</note> ſpeciall good. <hi>He that walketh in his integrity is ſafe:</hi> no danger can overtake or meete a man in that way; becauſe he is under the ſhadow and protection of divine providence. <hi>Righteouſneſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves him that is intire in the way, but wickedneſſe overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſinner,</hi> Prov. 13. 6. &amp; 11. 5, 6. Let integrity and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe preſerve me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 21. Integrity is a guard, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually keep watch and ward; and doth not only leade men to a good way, and tell them what is their duty, and fit to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; but maketh the way paſſible for them, and them proſperous in it. An intire heart, is a channell or Barke in which the graces of the Spirit are contained, and faith doth ſwimme above all ſtormes and tempeſts: but a mind void of all integrity, is full of ſliſters and chincks, that if the moſt holy liquour of piety be offered, it is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in and out together and at once. This is the nature of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that by it the ſoule is intire in it ſelfe, and hath a ſpirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, which may be ſhadowed forth by the ſimilitude of things corporall: and therefore ſo long as integrity is preſerved, the heart is apt to containe and keep ſafe the graces of the Spirit: if it be cracked grace would be loſt, ſhould not God make up the breaches of it. A ſoule deſtitute of grace, is ſtarke dead; an heart without integrity, not well compacted, is next to death or deſtruction; as a ſhip full of holes, or a body unlooſed or diſſolved. An heart well compact and knit faſt together in the Lord (as is the intire) is<note place="margin">Prov. 10. 29.</note> valiant and couragious in all dangers, trials, temptations. It is not put out of countenance with ſlanderous tongues, nor ſhaken with feare of troubles. <hi>Though mine adverſary ſhould write a booke againſt me, would I not take it upon my ſhoulder, and bind it as a crowne unto me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job?</hi> The hypocrite in peace and ſecurity may ſeeme ſtrong and valarous: but let God by ſome affliction
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55916:48"/> drag him out, as it were by the eares from his lurking hole, and convent him before his tribunall, and thou ſhalt not ſee any thing more abject and heartleſſe. Then is that of the Prophet verified, <hi>The ſinners in Sion are afraid, a feare is come among the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 33. 14, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us ſhall dwell with the everlaſting burning?</hi> But the entire heart, even in this caſe, holds out confident and couragious. And no marvell, for every man that walketh in his integrity hath the priviledge of a treble guard, the guard of Gods protection, of the good Angels, and of a good conſcience, for his defence againſt all adverſary power. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 37. 37. Pſ. 37. 40. Pſ. 91. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>for the end of that man is peace: for the Lord ſhall helpe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, he ſhall deliver him from the wicked, and ſave him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he trusteth in him. The Lord will defend the perfect, and he hath given his Angels charge over them, to beare them in their hands, and keepe them in their waies:</hi> In which reſpect they may ſay with the Prophet, how many ſoever riſe up againſt us, they be more and ſtronger that be with us, then they that riſe up againſt us. Moreover, they are bleſſed of God with a good conſcience, which is as a ſtrong Caſtle, againſt which no batteries of the enemy can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile; he is a moſt valiant Champion, who will not be daunted with any proud on-ſet of the Adverſary, which he knoweth to be weake, and of no ſtrength. As there is nothing more baſe, or ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner abaſhed then a corrupt conſcience, deſtitute of integrity: So nothing more bold and hardy then a good and perfect conſcience. <hi>David</hi> in the midſt of all his reproaches had the face to profeſſe the name of God before Kings and Princes, without ever being blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">Pſ. 119. 23.</note> at their preſence. And ſhall a man ſo guarded, regard the enmity of any? fear the threatnings of any, though never ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? be diſmayed at any hard condition that he is fallen into for the preſent? No, he will not be afraid for any evill tidings, for his heart is fixed and truſteth in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Integrity addeth to the glory of our good actions, even ſuch as are but of the lower ſort. There is not the meaneſt duty whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which integrity will not ſet a faire gloſſe upon, that in ſome reſpects it ſhall be matchable even to workes farre greater in their owne nature. A poore labouring man that lives by his hands, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed holy obedience to God therin with an entire heart, may have as much comfort on his death-bed, as the beſt Miniſter
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55916:49"/> or Magiſtrate, whoſe ſervice in it ſelfe is farre more honourable: yea, if his integrity be greater, his comfort alſo ſhall be greater. For God regards not ſo much the matter, as the forme of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: nor ſo much the thing done, as the affection wherewith we doe it. Wiſe men regard more the mind of the giver, then the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the gift. When we firſt give our hearts wholly and entirely to God, then is our ſervice, how ſmall ſoever, very acceptable unto his Majeſty. It is not the greatneſſe or multitude of thoſe good workes which we have done, but the good diſpoſition of an honeſt and entire heart in the doing of them, that doth bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as the internall qualification of that faith, which makes a ſound plea for mercy before the throne of grace. An halting heart daſheth the acceptance of the moſt glorious worke: an entire heart addeth weight to the baſeſt ſervice. The widdowes mite was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in worth, had not her good heart raiſed it's price. In value it came farre ſhort of the ſuperfluities that the rich men caſt into the treaſury; but her heart was better, and ſo her gift greater then theirs. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had received the ſentence of death, what was his comfort? even this, the conſcience of his integrity. <hi>O Lord remember how I have walked before thee in truth and with</hi>

               <p>The effect and token of integrity is a ſetled, wel-adviſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate deſire, reſolution, will and endeavour to be enformed, what is good and acceptable in the ſight of God, and to direct his wayes at all times, and in all places according to rule of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: for he aimes at one marke, and pitcheth upon the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.<note place="margin">Prov. 20. 7.</note> The juſt man walketh in his integrity.

               </p>
               <p>The fruits of this reſolution are theſe and ſuch like;</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is no ſin though never ſo deare, precious or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which a perfect Chriſtian would not willingly eſpy out and judge in himſelfe, <hi>I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorrie for</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it workes a diſlike of ſinne in all, even in thoſe which be moſt neare and deare unto us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is joyned with a continuall care to preſerve himſelfe<note place="margin">1 Ki. 15. 13, 14.

I was perfect before him, and I kept my ſelfe from mine iniquity.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In all conditions he will looke to himſelfe, that he be not carried away with unbridled paſſions.

Wherefore the entire Chriſtian doth ever look to his heart, that it be not diſtempered with theſe things.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If the heart be entire with God, it will admit his word<note place="margin">Prov. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Integrity is the gift of God, infuſed into the heart by the holy Ghoſt; but in this reſpect we may not neglect the meanes ordained of God for the attainment and preſervation of it. God and none but he did place <hi>David</hi> in the hill <hi>Syon,</hi> and give <hi>Gideon</hi> victory over the <hi>Midia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w, and firmely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but their beleef did not emaſculate their minds, or tie their hands from uſing ſuch ſtrength and valour, as they had.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Care muſt be had to furniſh the mind with the affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate knowledge of God in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>And thou Solomon my ſonne, know thou the God of thy Fathers, and ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Chron. 28. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>heart.</hi> The knowledge of God begets in us a ſimilitude of God. When we come to underſtand what he is to us, we are made to him what he requireth. As when ſound knowledge entereth, it ſtampeth the Image of God upon the heart: for it aſſimulates the mind to the object ſeen and diſcerned.</p>
               <p>2. All holy meanes muſt be uſed to incorporate the word into the heart, that it may ſeaſon every affection, and beare mild uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall Soveraignty over us. For the heart is tranſ-formed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55916:50"/> into the nature of the word, and every power of ſoul is brought into ſubjection by an unfained, ſoveraigne, well-rooted faith, it is entire in parts, though imperfect in degrees. Herein all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and paines muſt be taken by preparation, hearing, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obſervation of all unexpected occaſions of griefe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, feare, joy, or ſuch like, to bring the word into the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it may ſweeten their diſpoſition, and governe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>3. In all endeavours we muſt include prayer to God in the name of Chriſt, as a chiefe aſſociate: for God ordinarily lets in ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace at the ſame gate, at which honeſt hearted prayers goe out.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth meanes is, for a man alwayes to poſſeſſe his heart with the apprehenſion of Gods preſence, and ſo to keepe it in his feare continually; to walke with God, as being in his eye, and ſeeing him that is inviſible. This remembrance of Gods all-ſeeing preſence, will make men ſtudy to approve themſelves before God in all their courſes, and to ſticke unto him with their whole hearts. Could the eye of a jealous husband prie into every privy corner of his wives heart, ſhe would be afraid to hide any ſtrange lover in her ſecret affection. If but a man, nay if but a child could looke into our hearts, we durſt not deale doubly and deceitfully. What? God ſeeth us, and ſhall we dare to dally with him? Shall I give him part of my heart, and reſerve another part for the world, for pleaſure, for ſin? How ſhould not God find this out? for he ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the heart and reynes, and underſtandeth the ſecret cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of every ſoul.</p>
               <p>5. Another meanes is diligently to review all works of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and our affections in the doing of them: and to obſerve what diſcomfort and trouble follows the maimed and defective performance of good duties. And withall when we take our ſelves tardy, in an holy in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>gnation to take revenge of our ſelves, judging and condemning our ſelves before God. The very thinking of the after reckonings we muſt come unto, when we have done our work, will make us take heed how we doe it. The remembrance of the loſſe and puniſhment they ſhall ſuſtaine, whoſe works are not perfect before the Lord, will ſtirre up reſpect to every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. For who is there that uſeth for all his actions, at the dayes end to call himſelfe to a ſevere examination, as the hard
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55916:51"/> Maſter doth his ſervants, that muſt not needs in the very midſt of his actions, reaſon thus within himſelfe; anone all this which now I doe, muſt very narrowly be looked over, and if the reaſon why I doe it, my affections in doing, the worke it ſelfe be maimed, halt or ſuffer defect in the parts thereof, I ſhall ſmart for it. O the wrings and ſecret pinches which mine owne guilty heart will give me; yea, the ſentence which by Covenant I am tyed to paſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my ſelf, in caſe my heart be partiall to the Lord, and my work deformed?

               <p>Laſtly, It is good to meditate ſeriouſly on the joyes of heaven, and the rich recompence of reward reſerved for them that cleave unto the Lord with their whole hearts. If the happineſſe of Saints here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after doe rightly affect, and be ſoundly beleeved, a man will be contented to part with all that he hath to purchaſe that treaſure.

               <p>To ſtirre up himſelfe to ſtrive after perfection more and more, a Chriſtian muſt firſt ſhame himſelf for his halting, and make it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious; ah, the diviſion of my heart, the maimedneſſe of my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is ſo apparant, that I cannot conceale it from my conſcience. I have lodged ſinne, vanity, pleaſure, the world in the cloſet of my heart, which ſhould have been kept entire for the Lord. My purpoſes for good have been weake, my reſolutions variable, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by occurrences and occaſions I have been drawn aſide. In holy performances I have ſerved mine onw corrupt affections, and doing what is right, not done it with a perfect heart. Mine affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to good hath been partiall, baſe, deformed; In the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt matters I have been remiſſe, preciſe in leſſer: zealous in one, careleſſe in another: ready to run according to inclination, not looking to the direction of the truth. I have ſometimes been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to heare, not ſo carefull to meditate, and make the word mine own; eager and fiery againſt ſome particular notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but not vigilant to bridle raſh anger, boyſterous paſſions and indiſcreet and idle ſpeeches. My love to the children of God hath neither been pure, nor univerſall: I have been apt to admire ſome, diſ-eſteem others according as they carry themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and fit me in my humour. If he be a curſed deceiver,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55916:51"/> that having a male in his flock, doth offer that which is halt and lame to the Lord: how juſtly might I be confounded, who have wickedly departed from my God, and ſet my affections upon things of no value? Will an husband accept of divided love in his wife? will a Prince regard or take in good part, that which is lame, blind or ſick, for a preſent from his Subject? O Lord, I have dealt exceeding fooliſhly in tendering ſuch ſpotted ſervice unto thy Highneſſe.</p>

               <p>In the former overture of the Covenant by Gods appointment they offered ſacrifice, which was a type of Chriſt, and ſeale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55916:52"/> and propitiation by the bloud of Chriſt, under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the ſame continued: for ſo we reade, that <hi>Abraham</hi> built<note place="margin">Gen. 12. 7. and 22. 9.</note> Altars unto the Lord, and offered ſacrifice.

We may conceive, that God by this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement might now prove <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience therein, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a thing abhorrent to nature, which could not be before ſinne, becauſe it doth preſuppoſe ſinne and puniſhment: And it was a notable pledge of his faith, for if he could believe God in ſo dangerous and fearefull an execution, they might beleeve him in any other command or promiſe under the Covenant. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not without the ſhedding of bloud, becauſe the Covenant was not yet eſtabliſhed in the bloud of the Meſſiah, and that might leade the faithfull to the bloud of Chriſt, as aſſuring the purging away of ſinne by the ſame.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55916:52"/> ſo of all the promiſes made therein concerning things temporall to the ſeed and poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they ſtood in reference to the Covenant of Grace. All that were outwardly circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were not partakers of the ſpirituall bleſſings promiſed, yet was not Circumciſion altogether unprofitable unto them: but as they were within the Covenant, ſo did Circumciſion ſeale unto them the bleſſings of the Covenant. If they were externally in Covenant only and by profeſſion, it confirmed the promiſes of the earthly Canaan and ſome other outward things whereof they were partakers: If they were internally and effectually in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it confirmed the higheſt bleſſings unto them, which they obtained by faith. It appeares then, that all are not in Covenant after one manner, nor doe all that be in Covenant, equally partake of the ſame bleſſings: they that be outwardly in Covenant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the outward and baſeſt part of the Covenant, they that be truly in Covenant obtaine the bigheſt: but what bleſſings ſoever they enjoy, they are given according to the Covenant of Grace, and not of workes, given of free bounty to them that yeeld but partiall and fained obedience, and not merited by their works. But of this more at large in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>From all this it followeth, Firſt, that all the faithfull are of the ſame faith with <hi>Abraham.</hi> The Father and the Sonnes ſpirituall be of the ſame beliefe: as they doe partake of the ſame ſpirituall priviledges. It is one God that juſtifieth the circumciſion and the uncircumciſion, and it is the ſame faith whereby the Promiſes of mercy are embraced. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> is called the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and he beleeved in Chriſt as did <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Not only Promiſes of temporall good things, but of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and eternall were made to the Patriarks in the Covenant of Grace, and ſought and obtained by them. They looked for a City whoſe builder and maker the Lord is. Remiſſion of ſinnes and<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11, 12.</note> life everlaſting was preached in the Covenant, ſealed in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and typified by the Land of Canaan. To conceit the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be an aſſembly of bruite beaſts, which looked to be fed with earthly bleſſings alone, is highly to diſhonour them, and leſſen the grace and mercy of God towards them.</p>
               <p>3. Sacramentall phraſes, wherein the name of the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is given to the ſigne, are ancient and familiar; as Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is called the Covenant, and the rocke Chriſt. Why then ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55916:53"/> our Adverſaries ſtumble at this, that in the Sacrament of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, The Bread is called the body of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>4. In this expreſſion of the Covenant, the ſpirituall good things promiſed therein are limited to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his ſeed. But all Infants whatſoever are not comprehended under the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> To ſay many thouſand thouſands are excluded from the ſeales and outward adminiſtration of the Covenant, when yet every one is partaker of the good promiſed in the Covenant, is to ſpeake of our ſelves, and not according to the Word of God. We will not tie the grace of God to outward meanes: but ordinarily we cannot affirme they pertaine to the Covenant of Grace, and obtaine the higheſt bleſſings promiſed therein, whom God doth not vouchſafe ſo much as outwardly to receive into Covenant.</p>

               <p>NOw we are drawing downe to <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Covenant of Grace, which was revealed to the Church by his Miniſtery. The curſe of Gods revenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice had now ſeized upon mankind for many generations, even thouſands of yeares, ſo that now it was time for God to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mercy in the midſt of wrath, and to breake out into a clearer expreſſion of this free gratious Covenant, extended to a people ſprung up into a great number, and to be joyned together in an outward policie. The Covenant of free grace running downe in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed was daily caſt out, and grew wilde, as in the Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites, Edomites, Syrians, &amp;c. therefore God was now pleaſed to knit the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> together in a ſtronger, and (as I may call it) a ſtate Covenant, that things might grow better and not worſe, The body of the people to whom the Covenant pertained, was now growne populous and numerous, ſo that either it muſt grow wild, and come to nothing by it owne weight, or elſe be brought under the Covenant of God into a ſtate and nationall Church.</p>
               <p>The Covenant which God made with Iſrael is called the Old
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55916:53"/> Teſtament or the Law, not becauſe it was firſt, as ſome ſuppoſe, but becauſe it was to wax old, and to give place to the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Covenant ſucceeding, and finally to be aboliſhed.<note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But here at the firſt we meet with a great difficulty, How, and whether at all the Covenant of Grace, was manifeſted by <hi>Moſes?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some make the Old and New Teſtament, as the Covenant of workes and grace, oppoſite in ſubſtance and kind, and not in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree alone: and that to introduce an unſound diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> of promiſe ſet againſt Covenant or Teſtament, as though God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Grace unto the Fathers only by promiſe, and not by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, leaving all that <hi>Moſes</hi> puts under Covenant to be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works and old Teſtament, not conſidering that God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his promiſe of Grace to <hi>Abraham</hi> a Covenant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in every branch a compleat Covenant: not adverting that the Apoſtle (who knew how to ſpeake according to the ſence of the old Scriptures) cals the promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a Covenant or Teſtament. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. and the Covenant of promiſe, diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the degrees of manifeſtation. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. Neither can it be proved, that ever God made the Covenant of works with the creature fallen: but whenſoever the Scripture ſpeakes of Gods entring into Covenant with man fallen and plunged into ſinne, and for ſinne deſerving wrath, it muſt be underſtood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>Others make the Old Teſtament a Covenant ſubſervient to the Covenant of Grace, and deſcribe it to be that which God made with Iſrael in Mount Sinai, to prepare them to faith, and to inflame them with a deſire of the promiſe and Evangelicall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant (which otherwiſe had languiſhed in their minds) and to reſtrain them from wickedneſſe as it were with a bit and bridle, untill the time wherein God ſhould ſend the Spirit of adoption into their hearts, and governe them by the Law of liberty. This they make to agree with the Covenant of nature in this, that in both the one partie contracting is God, the other man, both hath a ſtipulation annexed, and that the ſame in reſpect of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law: the promiſe is the ſame in generall, and both leade un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. But to differ from it in this, that the Covenant of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made with all men, but this with the Iſraelites alone; that was made with man created and perfect in Paradiſe, and had
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55916:54"/> no <hi>preludia:</hi> this was made long after with ſome part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſinners, in Mount Sinai, and had many <hi>preludia:</hi> that bound to obedience due by the Law of nature, this to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alſo: in that the injoyment of life in Paradiſe was promiſed, here in the Land of Canaan: the Covenant of nature leads to Chriſt by accident, as it ſhewes what man doth owe unto God, and what puniſhment remaines if he pay not his debt of duty: the old Covenant leads unto Chriſt by it ſelfe, for that is the true and proper ſcope thereof, God exacting his due of man for none other end, but that the creature convicted of his imbecillity, ſhould flie to Chriſt. The Covenant of Nature leanes upon the Creation and generall conſervation; the old Covenant upon the Election of Iſrael, his deliverance out of Egypt, and conſervation in the Land of Canaan.</p>
               <p>The Covenant of Nature was written in the heart; but the old<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 24.</note> Covenant did beget to ſervitude, and ſo did compell and reſtraine by force, as when we leave undone what we would doe, or doe what we would not for feare: that is eternall, this temporary, written in Tables of ſtone; The thirſt after Chriſt which the Covenant of Nature doth ſtirre up in man, is allayed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt either in the Promiſe, or in the Goſpell: but the thirſt which the old Covenant ſtirred up, could not be allayed, but by the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>With the Covenant of Grace it agreeth, that the Author of both is God, both contracted with man a ſinner: both doth ſhew ſinne: both reſtraine from ſinne: both leade to Chriſt: both the Symbole of the Church: both made by a Mediatour, and life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in both. They differ in theſe, that in the Covenant ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient, God is conſidered as reproving ſinne, and approving righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: in the Covenant of Grace, as pardoning ſinne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing man in righteouſneſſe; the ſtipulation of the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, <hi>Doe this and live: Gal.</hi> 3. 12. Of the New, <hi>Beleeve, and thou ſhalt not come into judgement. Joh.</hi> 3. 18. The Old Teſtament was added to the Promiſe of Grace, which went before. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16, 17. and ſhewes ſinne not primarily, but by experience of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane weakneſſe in keeping Covenant. But the Covenant of Grace doth this primarily, for it teacheth expreſſely that all men are ſinners. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 23. and that his happineſſe doth conſiſt in the remiſſion of ſinnes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6. The old Covenant did reſtrain from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55916:54"/> ſinne by compulſion. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. 24. the Covenant of Grace with a free inclination of mind and ſoule. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12. The Covenant of Grace leads to Chriſt directly: the old Covenant indirectly. The old Covenant is the carnall Symbole of the Church of the Jewes, the new Covenant a ſpirituall Symbole of the Church both of Jewes and Gentiles. <hi>Moſes</hi> is the Mediatour of the old Covenant: Chriſt God and man Mediatour of the new. In the old Covenant is given the ſpirit of bondage; but the Spirit of Adoption in the new. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. The old Covenant was a meane to the end: the new the end it ſelfe. The old Covenant did ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the conſciences: the new doth comfort: Man a ſinner fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a ſleep is the object of the old Covenant: the conſcience ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with ſinne the object of the new. The old Covenant ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the manner of worſhipping God, but gave not ability: the new Covenant doth both. The old Covenant was an hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt us. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. the new an eaſie yoke. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. The old Covenant was from Mount Sinai. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. the new from Sion heavenly, amiable and pleaſant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. The old Covenant excludes the Gentiles: the new admits them. The old promiſeth life in Canaan: the new in Heaven. But not to examine theſe things particularly, by this explication it appeares, the Divines of this opinion, make the old Covenant differ from the new in ſubſtance, and kind, and not in degree of manifeſtation, as alſo did the former.</p>
               <p>Moſt Divines hold the old and new Covenant to be one in ſubſtance and kind, to differ only in degrees: but in ſetting down the differences they ſpeake ſo obſcurely, that it is hard to find how they conſent with themſelves. For moſt commonly they diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them thus: The old Teſtament promiſeth life to them that obey the Law, and condemnes all not perfectly conformable: the new doth freely pardon ſinnes, and give Salvation to them that believe in Chriſt. The old was written by the finger of God in tables of ſtone: the new by the Spirit of God in the fleſhie tables of the heart. The old was the miniſtery of death, a killing letter: the new the miniſtery of the quickning Spirit. The old did lay upon the necks of the Fathers an intollerable yoke of rites and commandements: the new doth impoſe the eaſie yoke of the Spirit, enduing us with the Spirit of Adoption and liberty of the Sonnes of God. The old doth involve the Doctrine of the Grace
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55916:55"/> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> under the ſhadowes of types and rites: the new doth containe the fulfilling of the tipes and figures. <hi>Moſes</hi> is the typicall Mediatour of the Old Teſtament: Chriſt is the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of the New. The old is ſealed by the blood of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the new is ratified by the blood of the Mediatour the and death of the Teſtatour. The Old by oblations did not pacifie the wrath of God, nor purge the conſcience: the new containes the true propitiation in the blood of Chriſt. The old was imperfect, intolerable, weake, and therfore to be aboliſhed: the new perfect, eaſy, and to continue for ever, &amp;c. with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like before mentioned. And many things herein are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken truly, but how all theſe differences ſhould ſtand, if they be not Covenants oppoſite in kind, it is not eaſy to underſtand. Some few have laboured to reconcile them one of theſe two wais. Firſt that the Old Teſtament doth promiſe life eternall plainly under the condition of morall obedience perfect, that is under a condition altogether unpoſſible, together with an heavy burden of legall rites and an yoke of moſt ſtrict pollicie, but covertly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the condition of repentance and faith in the Meſſias to come prefigured by tipes and ceremonies, that by this forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, worſhip and policie, a proud, groſſe, and ſtiffe-necked people might be more tamed, and convinced of their owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe: and that by ſuch a pedagogue they might be led to Chriſt, who was more obſcurely manifeſted under thoſe ſhadows. The ſecond is, By a diſtinction of <hi>Moſes</hi> his propoſition of the Law from God unto that people: which (as they would) is done either with exaction of perfect obedience deſerving eternall life, and threatning eternall curſe to all that continue not in every thing of the booke of the Law to doe it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. or in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable moderation and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> promiſing bleſſings to thoſe who doe what they can to performe it. The firſt is a perfect and exact draught of the Law of prime nature: the ſecond a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erſwaſion and incouragement to corrupt nature to ſtirre up the relicks of power and the Image of God upon hope of future good. The firſt is propounded to all mankind, this to the Church, though others, take benefit by it. In the firſt the Law breaths nothing but wrath to fallen nature, for that hath no grace nor mercy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. In the ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes Goſpell to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward happineſſe of particulars, and the proſperity of the whole.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55916:55"/> The firſt and rigid propoſition is of the Morall Law alone, and as it was contained in the firſt writing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The ſecond is laid downe in <hi>Moſes</hi> whole frame and oeconomy to that people. The firſt ſtands in full oppoſition to the Covenant of Grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a perfect Covenant of workes: but the ſecond is and may be ſubordinate to the Covenant of Grace, as will appeare. And this diſtinction (as they conceive) is further ſtrengthened by the preparation unto the firſt delivery, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. and what ſtrictneſſe was there required in the people to prepare themſelves for their perſons, and what a ſtraite charge was given not to come neere the Mount, leaſt they die, Verſ. 12. in the delivery what terrible voices, lightnings, thunders, fire, &amp;c. with the quaking of the earth, ſo that neither Prieſt nor people muſt come neare leaſt they ſhould be conſumed of wrath in the giving of the Law, which when the people heard and ſaw, they could not endure, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to be Mediatour betwixt God and them, leaſt if they ſhould heare God, they ſhould die: which was the ground of that Aphoriſme, <hi>Who ever ſaw God and lived;</hi> yea ſuch was the terror that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe ſaid, <hi>I feare and quake, Heb.</hi> 12. 21. Thus the Morall Law was firſt given by God: but not written till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond going up, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 12. where God promiſeth to find the tables, and write in them with his owne finger: and ſuch was the feare of the ſecond delivery, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was glad to lenifie the former by reading the judicialls, which he had writ, and to offer ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>Moſes</hi> goes up the ſecond time, and receives the two tables tarrying there forty dayes. Whileſt <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtayed the people brake the Covenant by Idolatry. God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> downe, and by wiſe providence ſo ordered, that <hi>Moſes</hi> brake the Tables of the Covenant; and now was all daſht, and <hi>Moſes</hi> to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to mediate for this ſinne in <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people, <hi>Exod. 32. 19. Deut.</hi> 9. Hitherto in the delivery and writing of the Law Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thunders nothing but wrath: and the more Law, the leſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, till the Law was vailed and ſhadowed from them in the curſe of it. <hi>Moſes</hi> having thus travailed and broken thoſe bare and open Tables, wherein was curſe and plague with open face painted, he is called up againe. <hi>Exod. 34. Deut.</hi> 2. 1. but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what alteration. For firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> now muſt hew the Tables, God would not deale with that, ſignifying that he would
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55916:56"/> have the Mediatour <hi>Moſes</hi> to have more to doe with the delivery of the ſecond writing then at the firſt, which was the prologue to the lenifying of the Law, wherewith man had to doe. 2. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> muſt bring the Tables up, and God would write the words before written, which ſhewed that God could not, nor would not alter the Law, which was a perfect draught of the firſt Law imprinted in <hi>Adam.</hi> 3. Conſider that here was no preparation, nor any terror of wonders, but a ſoft breath of God in this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, noting this, that God had ſufficiently thundred wrath in the former delivery, and now ſeekes to cover it that the people might heare and obey. 4. <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt provide an Arke to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Tables, which was not only for the ſafe keeping of the Tables, but to cover the wrath and curſe, that the people ſhould not ſee it, which was the firſt vaile. 5. We doe not reade that ever the Lord would have either the people or Prieſt to reade theſe words out of ſtone, but as they were mollifyed by <hi>Moſes</hi> his tranſcription, in his bookes eſpecially; wherein Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were to reade the duties of the Covenant and the promiſes. No more tables, there they are, but deale not with them, there is wrath at the firſt opening: which was the reaſon why God ſmote the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> with ſuch a ſlaughter, becauſe they durſt looke into, and reade upon theſe tables of the Arke of the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. 6. We reade that God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 5. when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtanding before the Lord with his prepared tables, the Lord deſcended, and proclaimed, <hi>The Lord, The Lord,</hi> and ſaid. <hi>The Lord God mercifull and gratious, long ſuffering and aboundant in mercy and truth, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne.</hi> Thus the Lord would take away the edge of the curſe, though he would write it for ends unmentioned. Then the Lord upon the Mount rehearſed the Covenant of grace with Iſrael, and cauſeth <hi>Moſes</hi> the Mediatour to write it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 27. And now he had in his hand both the Covenant of works and of grace, the one hid in the Arke, the other open in his hand: the ſame Commandements, but the one with wrath, the other lenified by God. 7. When <hi>Moſes</hi> came downe this appearance of God had changed the skin of his face, that he was glad to put a vaile upon him, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the people could not, nay durſt not behold him, but ranne from him, as at firſt from God, when he delivered the Law upon Mount <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Conſider that till the Law as a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e draught of natures Law was marked and thus vailed at <hi>Moſes</hi> his propoſition of the remedy unto theſe carnall Iſraelites, in the blood of the ſacrifices, writ in the Ceremoniall Law, it could not quiet them, nor pacifie their conſciences. 9. Obſerve this one thing further, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in the five bookes doth ſo ſhun this rigid propoſition of the Law, that the Apoſtle when he came to deale with the falſe Apoſtles about this acceptation of the Law as ſtanding full againſt the Covenant of Grace and Juſtification by faith, could find but two teſtimonies in all <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily convinced this manner of propounding the Law, the one, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. the other, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. But becauſe this end of the vailing of <hi>Moſes</hi> his face, as tending to ſignifie the curſe of the Morall Law, and the vailing of it from the eyes of carnall <hi>Iſrael</hi> is called into queſtion by ſome of prized judgement, and that from the paſſage of 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. they ſpend one propoſition in clearing that place to prove that it was the vailing of the Morall Law in the Curſe. For firſt ſay they, it could not be the vailing of the blood of Chriſt in the Ceremonials; for the Ceremonies was a ſufficient vaile to hide that, and to have put an other vaile had been againſt Gods love, who would have the people ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to looke into it for Salvation: one vaile was ſufficient to hide ſo precious a treaſure. But to the Text, it is plaine in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Chapter 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. that the Apoſtle meanes the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Law in their hearts, namely the Commandements of the Morall Law by removing the Curſe, that the heart may cloſe in with it. Secondly, Verſ. 6. The miniſtery of the Spirit is oppoſed not to the Cloud of Ceremonies, but to the letter of the Law Morall: for this killeth, ſo did not the Ceremony, but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his meaſure. Thirdly. Verſ. 7. The Miniſtery of the Goſpell is oppoſed to that which was graven in ſtone, which was the Morall Law only. Fourthly, Verſ. 13. <hi>Moſes</hi> his vaile was put on when <hi>Moſes</hi> was read, and not the Ceremoniall Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, as intending the vailing of the Curſe of the Morall Law. Fifthly, That which beares ſhew is Verſ. 14. where the Text faith, that the vaile was taken away in Chriſt. It is true that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55916:57"/> the Ceremonies were removed in the comming of the ſubſtance, but is it not as true, and here meant, that the curſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Law was removed by the comming of Chriſt, and ſo the vaile made needleſſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. But Verſ. 15. the vaile yet remaines when <hi>Moſes</hi> is read, which cannot be the Ceremony vailing the blood of Chriſt, for that is removed in act: for the Jewes ſacrifice not for want of an Altar: but it is moſt true of the vaile of the Morall Law to cover wrath. For as it was a mercy to vaile it to that people till Chriſt came, ſo it is now a judgement Chriſt being come to ſhade it. For it might be, if ſeene, an accidentall cauſe to drive them to Jeſus the Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> for a Saviour. But the knot lyeth in the 18. verſe, <hi>But we all &amp;c.</hi> where it is thought, and ſtrongly ſpoken, that the vaile ſignifieth the Ceremoniall Law. It is true there is a flat oppoſition of Chriſtian and Jew, the one with open face beholding Chriſt, the other not daring to ſee the glory of the Lord in giving the Law. But all will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent if it be ſhewed what is here meant by the Image of Chriſt, which we behold with open face, which is not the blood of Chriſt vailed in the blood of the Sacrifices, but the Law of God writ in his heart, (promiſed <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34.) as the head, which is the new command of the Morall Law, ſet up for us as a glaſſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlding by faith, we are changed into the ſame Image by the Spirit, and now it will appeare that the whole Chapter ſpeakes of the Morall Law.</p>
               <p>Another inforcement of this diſtinction is from the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. where he diſputes againſt the Morall Law taken as a rigid draught of natures Law, unto the 23. verſe, for otherwiſe the Law had been no enemy unto him as a branch of the Covenant of Grace: but at the 23. verſe he diſputes the good ends of it, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with Gods moderation. By the Law which we call the Morall Law, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> meane the meere draught of the Law of nature, as it hath neceſſarily affixed eternall life to the punctuall performance, or eternall curſe to the diſobeyers in the leaſt title. For the Law is <hi>complexum quiddam,</hi> containing in it command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bleſſing and curſing.

                  </hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> men had forgotten what was ſinne, and had oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the very Law of nature. Therefore God ſets out the lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of it by <hi>Moſes</hi> in this draught and abſtract, to which end, all the commands ſaving two are propounded in the negative, that ſo men by the Church might know the nature of ſinne againe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God propounds the Law with curſe eternall to work death, and to ſhew Gods eternall diſpleaſure againſt ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. which was uſefull not only to the world and wicked in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but ſpecially to the ſtiff-necked and refractory Nation, to be as a rod to ſcourge all their rebellions and backſlidings. The Law thus laced with bleſſings and curſings eternall, abſtracted from the reſt of his frame, makes <hi>Moſes</hi> now to begin to breath bleſſings, and no leſſe then Goſpel. This comming from a pacified God (as <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 6, 7, 8.) may be looked on by the fallen creature with comfort, and from this conſideration it is that we affirme this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with the body of Iſrael to be a Covenant of Grace: for it is one, and therefore never by <hi>Moſes</hi> called Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
               <p>Again, It cannot be denied, that ſo farre as it concerned the ſpirituall I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſeeme not to remove the doubt. Not the firſt, becauſe it cannot be conceived how the old Covenant ſhould as a condition of the Covenant, exact perfect obedience deſerving life as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, and yet promiſe pardon to the repentant belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: for theſe two are contrary the one to the other.

Leaſt the Jewes ſhould feare (as it commeth to paſſe in doubtfull matters) they heare that the rule of life is preſcribed unto them of the true and only God, who is theirs by Covenant. Leaſt diffidence ſhould make them ſlacke, God comes familiarly, and commends his gracious Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. The reaſon from all this is plaine, that Covenant wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord promiſeth, or proclaimeth himſelfe to be the God of Iſrael, is the Covenant of grace, which God made with Iſrael.

                  <hi>Ye ſhall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye tempted him in Maſſah;</hi> for there they tempted God by incredulity. Where it is moſt apparent, that in this firſt Precept we are enjoyned to take God to be our God, to chooſe him to be our portion, to cleave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to truſt in him as our only Saviour. And it can hardly be queſtioned, whether that Covenant wherin we are bound to take God to be our Father, King and Saviour be the Covenant of grace or no? And by the ſame reaſon it is manifeſt, that the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth faith as well as love and obedience, and doth build theſe upon it as a foundation. It preſcribeth faith in the firſt place, and throughout, namely that we acknowledge God the Law-giver, to be the Lord our God, the only true God, and teſtifie that faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, by an univerſall and uniforme obedience to that whole Law and every title thereof. The Law was given for this end, that it might inſtruct us in faith, which is the mother of a good conſcience and of love. Chriſt and faith is the end and ſoule of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55916:60"/> Law, not underſtood of the Jews. The ſumme of the Law is faith or love, and both theſe carry the ſame ſence, becauſe though <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>

Certainly, <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith is ſinne,</hi> even all works, though good in ſhew, and for ſubſtance ſeeming agreeable to the rule of the Law, if they iſſue not from faith, they are vaine and hypocriticall, if they be not quickned and enlivened by faith, they are but the carkaſſe of a good worke. And then if God command not faith in the Law in ſome ſort, why doth he command other things, which without it are frivolous? Our beſt works are unſavoury before God, if they be not ſeaſoned with faith: <hi>For without</hi>

For when the Law is ſpirituall, and commandeth true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and invocation, how can it be obſerved without faith? Would the Lord have the Iſraelites remaining in infidelity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Law? Or did he ever allow man ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> to come or have acceſſe unto him, but only in the name of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour? Or was life and ſalvation ever promiſed to man ſince the fall, but upon condition of faith in the Meſſiah? Indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of obedience, which God requireth and man promiſeth, is the chiefeſt thing urged in the Law: but free and gracious pardon, wherein conſiſteth the happineſſe of the Saints is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in promiſed and proclaimed. They under the old Teſtament light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly following the letter, miſtooke the meaning, not looking to the end of that which was to be aboliſhed, whereunto <hi>Moſes</hi> had an eye under the vaile. For they perceived not ſo well the grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the legall Teſtament, which the perfection of the morall Law, whereof they could not but faile, ſhould have forced them to ſeeke; and the imperfection of the typicall Law, which made nothing perfect, ſhould have led them to find: but they generally reſted in the worke done, as was commanded by either Law, when as themſelves were unable to do the one, and the other was in it ſelf as unſufficient to help them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, after the giving of the Law a Covenant betwixt God and Iſrael was eſtabliſhed by mutuall and willing conſent,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 31. Exod. 24. 3, 4.</note> the people promiſing to obey and doe whatſoever the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.

This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they entred into was the ſame that God made with them upon Mount Sinai, even the ſame that did containe the bleſſings and curſes before pronounced. But this Covenant was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, not of works: for God never commanded his people, that he might ſet them on high above all people of the earth, and that they might be an holy people unto him, to avouch him to be their God by a Covenant of works: <hi>Moſes</hi> would<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 12.</note> never have exhorted the people by Oath to bind themſelves unto the Lord in a Covenant of works: for that had been to bind themſelves unto the moſt dreadfull curſes, whereas they were to enter into this Covenant that they might proſper in all that they<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 9.</note> doe. That Covenant is of Grace, wherein the good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed are all free and gratious: but it was of grace that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed<note place="margin">Deut. 7. 12. 2 Chro. 6. 14.</note> to be the God of Iſrael: and therefore the Lord, when he keepeth Covenant with Iſrael, is ſaid to keep the mercy which he ſwore unto their Fathers, and when he eſtabliſhed them for a people unto himſelfe, and is their God, he is ſaid to performe the Oath, which he ſwore unto their Fathers, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Jacob.</hi>

               <p>The Legall Covenant or Covenant of works cannot be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after it is once broken, ſeeing it admitteth not repentance of ſinne paſt, but exacts perfect and perpetuall obedience.

               <p>Eighthly, the Law requireth faith as well as love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and doth build theſe upon it as a foundation. For <hi>the end of the Commandement is love,</hi> love <hi>out of a pure heart, a good conſcience, and faith unfained.</hi> That love which the Law requireth, either towards God or towards man, muſt flow from a pure heart, and faith it is that purifieth the heart. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> and <hi>the Law is a Schoole-master to bring us unto Chriſt.</hi> But bring us unto Chriſt it could not, if it did not point him out unto us, or preſuppoſe him as promiſed: He is not the end of the Law, if the Law did not direct to him, and require faith in him.

The deliverance of the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, was a type of our ſpirituall deliverance from the bondage of ſinne and Satan, by the power of Chriſt; as appeares by the Ceremonie and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that corporall deliverance, the Paſſeover, which was a<note place="margin">Joh. 19. 36. 1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> figure of Chriſt our Saviour. Therefore in the firſt Precept the Myſtery of our Redemption by Chriſt is taught and contained. That particular mercy mentioned in that Precept, taught the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites to expect ſpirituall Salvation in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed. In<note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 1, 2.

The true worſhippers of God then are happy, not for their works, but becauſe God is pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them in Chriſt, and to pardon their offences. This is the true ſenſe of thoſe promiſes made to or ſpoken of them that walk in the perfect way, and doe none iniquity. And if life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be promiſed to them that obſerve and keep the Statutes, Judgements and Ordinances of the Lord, not for the dignity of the work, but through the meere grace and mercy of God pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning tranſgreſſions and ſinnes, then is faith in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> taught and commanded in the Law. The true ſenſe and meaning of the Law is to be gathered out of the writings of the Prophets: for the ſame Spirit that breathed the Law, informed them in what<note place="margin">Jer. 4. 1, 2, 3. and 3. 13, 14. &amp;c. Rom. 3. 21, 22. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Law is teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c. Deut. 12. 32. and 31. 12.</note> ſenſe the Law was given, and how to be underſtood. But by the Expoſition of the Prophets it is cleare, that the Law as it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes</hi> did admit repentance, and conſequently, require faith in Chriſt. And if the Law did not command faith in Chriſt the Meſſiah, then might not the Jewes beleeve in him: for they were forbidden to adde any thing thereto, or to take ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. The Law was to the Jewes a rule, according to which they ought both to live and worſhip God, to which they might not adde the leaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot or title of their owne heads: ſo that either
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55916:63"/> they muſt not worſhip, praiſe, pray unto and believe in God in and through the Meſſiah, or elſe faith in him muſt neceſſarily be required. The Decalogue, if we preciſely conſider the things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed therein, doth not containe many things written of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but as it was a ſumme and abridgement of the whole Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto every particular muſt be referred, and from which, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it was derived, it is a perfect rule whereunto nothing might be added. And if without faith it be impoſſible to pleaſe God, or to obtaine Salvation, the Law which promiſeth eternall life to them that keep it, doth require faith as well as love or obedience. For if faith be neceſſary to Salvation, it cannot be that man a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhould be juſtified, if he could keep the Law: becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by future works purchaſe Redemption from former tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions. And from all this it followeth, that the Law as it was given to the Jewes, is for ſubſtance the Covenant of grace, or a rule according to which the people in Covenant ought to walke. The Law is and ever was a rule of life to men in Covenant. <hi>Matt. 5. 18. One jot or title of the Law ſhall in no wiſe paſſe, till all be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> fulfilled in reſpect of unpartiall and ſincere obedience, for of that our Saviour ſpeakes, as is manifeſt by the words following, <hi>He that ſhall breake the least of theſe Commandements, and teach men ſo, ſhall be called leaſt in the Kingdome of Heaven: except your righteouſneſſe ſhall exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees;</hi> that is, righteouſneſſe of habite and practiſe, which is that which the Law, as it is taken in that place, required.</p>
               <p>Many things are objected to the contrary, which muſt be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before we paſſe further.

For when God ſaith, he is their God, who delivered them out of the Land of Egypt, doth he not propound himſelf a Redeemer, a ſpirituall Redeemer of them from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne and Satan, whereof that deliverance was a type? But he is not a Redeemer from ſpirituall bondage but in Chriſt. Implicitely therefore in theſe words Chriſt is contained and propoſed unto us, which is done according to the condition of thoſe times, wherein as yet all things were infolded and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up. And it cannot eaſily be imagined, how Chriſt ſhould be revealed in the Ceremoniall Law, if there be no mention of him expreſſe or implicite in theſe words. As the Morall Law doth ſhew and diſcover ſinne, ſo was the Ceremoniall Law as a bill or bond put into the hand of God, whereby they did acknowledge themſelves indebted to his Divine Majeſtie: and as the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law was a Schoole-maſter to point out and direct us unto Chriſt: ſo was the Morall a rule of obedience to them that be in Covenant with God: which of neceſſity doth preſuppoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt in ſome ſort. The Ninevites in the threatnings denounced againſt them by the Prophet <hi>Jonas</hi> did apprehend a promiſe of mercy to be implyed upon condition of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: which promiſe was made in Chriſt. And is it any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell then we ſhould affirme, the knowledge of Chriſt to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in ſome ſort, in thoſe words of the Law: if we conſider the words of the Law, it doth command that we love God above all, and our Neighbour as our ſelves: but if we ſearch out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the words, we ſhall find it to be ſuch a love as proceeds from faith; and from what faith, but in the Meſſiah? That is the foundation upon which all works of love are builded. In faith it ſelf or with it, there is a motion of the ſoule towards, or a deſire of the heart to obtaine the good promiſed, joyned with an hatred of ſinne and wickedneſſe, which may be called inchoate love: but true, ſound, intire love, whereby we affect God as our Father moſt neerely conjoyned to us, and reverence him as the fountaine of all good things and benefits, which of his meere grace he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth upon the children of his love, and we daily expect from him, even ſuch as accompany life and ſalvation: this is the effect of faith, and followeth the apprehenſion and habitation of Chriſt in the heart.</p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:55916:64"/>
               <p>Faith in Chriſt is not commanded in the Morall Law as it was engraven in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency: but as it was given to Iſrael, to be a rule of life to a people in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it was preſuppoſed or commanded. For the generall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of duty, the Law then delivered and formerly engraven in the heart was one and the ſame: but not in reſpect of the ſubject by whom, the object to whom, or the grounds whereupon obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was required. Confidence in God was required of <hi>Adam</hi> by the Law of nature written in his heart. Confidence in God through Chriſt or the Meſſiah was required of the Iſraelites by the Law publiſhed upon the Mount. <hi>Adam</hi> was to performe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Lord immediately without a Mediatour, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe pure and innocent.

But to the Iſraelites God bound himſelfe in Covenant upon Mount Sinai, promiſing to be their God, and take them for his people, notwithſtanding they were ſinners in themſelves, which could not be without forgiveneſſe: and this Covenant they might and did renew by repentance after tranſgreſſion. The Law is not to be confounded with the Goſpell, but the ſacred and inviolable knot of the one with the other is to be maintained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we ſhall make God contrary to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Law doth not ſo directly and expreſſely teach faith in<note place="margin">When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Faith came by the Goſpell: it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the manner of propounding, vvithout the invvrappings of types: that the Doctrine vvas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Goſpell doth more fully reveale Chriſt, and the grace of God in him, commanding faith by name: but it doth alſo urge, preſſe, and exact obedience. Thus ſweetly doe the Law and Goſpell conſent together. But here it is to be noted, that faith is commanded in the Law, which exacteth every thing that is good, but it is given to us, not by the Law, but of the holy Ghoſt. The diſtinction of the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell as they are oppoſed one to another is cleare and evident: but as the Law was given to the Jewes it is not oppoſite, but ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the Goſpell. The Law in it ſelfe conſidered exacted perfection of works as the cauſe of life: but when that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to man by reaſon of the infirmity of his fleſh, it pleaſed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55916:65"/> the Lord to make knowne to his people by the miniſtery of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> that the Law was given, not to detaine men in confidence of their own works, but to leade them unto Chriſt. Whatſoever the Law teacheth, whatſoever it promiſeth, whatſoever it comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, alwayes it hath Chriſt for the ſcope thereof. For though the Law of righteouſneſſe promiſe a reward to the keepers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yet after it hath ſhut up all men under ſinne, it doth ſubſtitute another righteouſneſſe in Chriſt, which is received by faith, not purchaſed by the merit of works. And therefore the Apoſtle doth reprehend the Jewes, as perverters of the true ſenſe and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 4, 5, 6, &amp;c.</note> of the Law, when they ſought to be juſtified by their works, and ſheweth that <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them to look for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Meſſiah, and ſeek for that righteouſneſſe which is by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereby it is manifeſt, that the Law was given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

For what word was that which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith was neere, even in their hearts, but the Law which the Lord gave upon Mount Sinai, and promiſed to write in the hearts of his people under the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>And from this ground it is not hard to anſwer what is further objected againſt this truth, as, If faith be commanded in the Law, then being juſtified by faith, we are juſtified by the works of the Law. For faith is not a work of the Law nakedly and abſolutely conſidered, as it exacteth perfect obedience of man in his own perſon: but of the Law as it was given to the Jewes, to direct them unto Chriſt, who is the ſoule and life of the Law. And though it be commanded in the Law, as it is in the Goſpel or new Covenant, yet it juſtifieth not as a part of Regeneration, or an act of obedience and work of Grace by it worth or dignity, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that office whereunto it is aſſigned of God, and as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the promiſes of mercy. It is a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>phiſticall forme of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſay, Faith is commanded in the Goſpell, therefore if we be juſtified by faith, we are juſtified by the works of grace. The arguments are like, and both faultie. For juſtification by faith in Chriſt is oppoſed to juſtification by the works of the Law: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he only is juſtified before God by the Law, whoſe acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined by the Law, are found juſt and righteous according
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55916:65"/> to that which the Law requireth: but he is juſtified by faith, who being in himſelf ungodly, believeth in Chriſt for ſalvation. So that according to the Apoſtles meaning, whereſoever faith be commanded, he is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law, who is acquitted from ſin by the meer and rich grace of God in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt received by faith: And to ſeek juſtification by works, is to reſt upon our works for ſalvation, as they that anſwer in all things to that righteouſneſſe perſonall which the Law requireth. Juſtification by faith, and juſtification by workes are oppoſite, and ſo is faith and workes: but faith is not oppoſed to one act commanded, whereby the promiſe is received, for then it ſhould be contrary to it ſelfe: but to works where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Law is fulfilled in our owne perſons: to workes I ſay, not to one work: becauſe no one worke can juſtifie, but all are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, the Apoſtle doth every where oppoſe the Law and the Goſpel, or the old and new Teſtament. The anſwer is from the ſame ground; that in the Scriptures of the new Teſtament, the Law as well Ceremoniall as Morall is oppoſed to faith or the Goſpel: and yet the Ceremonies of the Law did prefigure Chriſt, as all men acknowledge. Therefore the Apoſtle doth not perpetually and abſolutely oppoſe the Law, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace: for he teacheth expreſly, that faith eſtabliſheth<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 31.</note> the Law. For he underſtood the force and ſentence of the Law to conſiſt in faith: but becauſe the Jews addicted to the latter of the Law, did pretermit the force and life of it, <hi>Paul</hi> proves the Law ſo taken and ſeparated from faith, to be the cauſe, not of life, but of death: as that which did not only want Chriſt, who is the ſoul of the Law, but is oppoſite to him. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth this, becauſe the Jews, (faith being let paſſe.) did ſeek righteouſneſſe in the dead works of the Law, and did oppoſe the Law to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and Chriſt, who was the end and ſcope of the Law. This will be more plain, if we ſhall examin the particular paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein this matter is handled.

So was the old Teſtament or Law, and all ſuch as lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed it, rather ſubordinate allies, then foes or adverſaries to the new Teſtament or heires of promiſe.

And in this ſence the two diſpoſitions differ, not only in circumſtances, but in ſubſtance: they be not only two, but oppoſite. By the way let it be obſerved, that by the former Covenant upon Mount Sinai, is underſtood the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> both Ceremoniall conſiſting in divers rites and commandements, and Morall, as the Jewes ſought to be juſtified thereby, who refuſed Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Old Teſtament then and the New, are ſometimes compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and conſidered by ſacred writers, as the thing including and included, the Huske and the Graine. The Goſpell before Chriſts time, was in the Law as the Corne new ſet in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Old Teſtament or Law (thus ſevered from it) remaines only as the chaffe or huske; If we thus conſider the Law or Old Teſtament, as the Jewes embrace it, that is, altogether ſevered from the new, to which alone we Chriſtians adhere by faith, they are not only two, but two oppoſites or contraries.

                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 1, 27.</note> alſo to write the ſame. Therfore the words of the Prophet as touching the writing of Gods Law in our hearts, can import no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this, that the Lawes which were before by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26, 27. 2 Cor. 3. 1, 2, 3.</note> of <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered only in Inke and Paper, ſhould by the power of the holy Ghoſt, through the faith of Chriſt be wrought and written in the affections of the heart: that God in Chriſt would not only adminiſter outwardly the letter of the Law, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in writing or preaching, but would by the regeneration of the Spirit, give grace inwardly to the obedience thereof. And as the Law written in the tables of the heart, and ingraven in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, is one for ſubſtance: ſo is the new and the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. The Law is not oppoſed to the Law: but the writing to writing. Writing in tables of ſtone pertained to <hi>Moſes</hi> or to the Old Teſtament: writing in the heart to Chriſt, or the new Covenant. The Law is the ſame, but otherwiſe adminiſtred in the hand of Chriſt, then in times paſt in the hand of <hi>Moſes. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> gave the Law in tables of ſtone, but could not give power or ability to doe what the Law required: but Chriſt writeth the Law in the heart, and inableth the faithfull in ſome meaſure to doe what he commandeth. And in the ſame place the Lord by the Prophet ſheweth, that when he made this Covenant with<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 32.</note> the Fathers which they brake, he declared himſelfe to be an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto them, or joyned himſelfe in marriage unto them. But God never joyned himſelfe in marriage unto a people, but by the Covenant of grace. It may be ſaid the Apoſtle ſheweth the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 14.</note> Covenant to be faultie, or that another Covenant was lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But that is not mentioned to prove the Covenants to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55916:67"/> two in ſubſtance oppoſite one to the other: but becauſe the firſt Teſtament did not containe the Image of the things themſelves, and therfore was not to be reſted in, as if we could be juſtified by<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 1.</note> the workes of the Law, or ceremoniall obſervances annexed: but muſt be uſed as an introduction to leade us unto Chriſt, who is the very Image of the things themſelves. This firſt Covenant therfore could not be fulfilled or effectuall, but by the bringing in of a ſecond, which was prefigured thereby. For the blood of Bulls and Goats was not availeable to purge away ſinne: but did prefigure the blood of Chriſt, which is effectuall to purge our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead workes. <hi>The blood of Bulls and of Goats, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>the aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the uncleane, ſanctifieth to the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the fleſh,</hi> ſc. from a treſpaſſe meerely committed againſt the Law of Ceremonies: but the bloody ſacrifice of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt, whereof the legall Sacrifices were tipes and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, was alone appointed of God, and is effectuall to cleanſe us from all ſinnes committed againſt the Morall Law of God, and to purifie us from ſuch dead works, as, not expiated by his blood, would bring forth everlaſting death. Of neceſſity therfore the firſt Covenant, becauſe it is of grace, muſt bring forth a ſecond,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 17. Joh. 5. 46.</note> in which is fulfilled that which in the firſt is prefigured. The Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the righteouſneſſe of faith was taught by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as our Saviour teſtifieth. Why then doth the Apoſtle in the words following add by way of oppoſition, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt? The ſence of the place ſeemes to be this, That the Law prefiguring Chriſt, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him, and teaching and commanding what oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

For the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it is referred to the mind and counſell of the Lord, is bright and illuſtrious: but the carnall people could not behold that brightneſſe, and therefore the Law is vailed to the carnall Jew, that he cannot behold the light that ſhineth therein. <hi>Even unto this day, when Moſes is read, the vaile</hi>

For there was a double vaile drawne over their eyes, the firſt of hatred againſt Chriſt, the ſecond of the Law it ſelfe, in which Chriſt was revealed, but not ſo clearely as in the Goſpell: which double vaile ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken<note place="margin">Iſa. 25. 7.

                  </note> the <hi>Galathians</hi> the Apoſtle oppoſeth the Covenant of Grace to the Law in many things; as that the Law accurſeth every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the booke of the Law to doe them: that it was foure hundred and thirty yeares after the Covenant, which was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, &amp;c. But it is to be remembred, that in thoſe paſſages the Apoſtle diſputeth againſt the Jewes, who truſted in the workes of the Law, and thought by the blood of Bulls and Goats to be purged from their ſinnes, or of them that joyned the Law with Chriſt in the matter of Juſtification, as if Juſtification had been in part at leaſt by the workes of the Law; which the Apoſtle e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where condemnes as contrary to the intent and purpoſe of the Lord in giving the Law. The contrariety then of the Law or Old Teſtament, even of the Law as it beareth the figurative ſprinkling of the bloud of Chriſt, and ſo pointeth us to him, unto the new Teſtament, or Covenant of grace, is not in themſelves, but in the ignorance, pride and hardneſſe of heart of them, who underſtood not, or did pervert the right end of the Law, as if it was given for Juſtification. The Law as it oppoſed to Chriſt, doth accurſe every one that continueth not in all things, that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of the Law to doe them: becauſe he that truſteth in the Law, is convinced by the Law to be a tranſgreſſour: but the Law as given to them that be in Covenant, doth reprove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tranſgreſſion, and convince every man of ſinne, who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them, but doth not accurſe the offendour in every jot or title, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Chriſt ſin is pardoned and forgiven. To the Jew, who reſted in the works of the Law, and refuſed Chriſt, the Law which was given foure hundred and thirty yeares after, did make void the promiſe, or Covenant confirmed before of God in Chriſt: But according to the true meaning of the Law, and to them that uſed it aright, it did not make void the promiſe but eſtabliſh it. What the Apoſtle citeth of the Law out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the giving of the Law after the promiſe, is for ſubſtance preached by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> at the Lords appointment, when he ſpeaketh of this Covenant of grace without all queſtion. <hi>Heare

That I may performe the oath which I have ſworne unto your Fathers, to give them a Land flowing with milke and honey, as it is this day: Then anſwered I and ſaid, ſo be it, O Lord. Then the Lord ſaid unto me, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all theſe words in the Cities of Judah, and in the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, ſaying, Heare ye the words of this Covenant, and doe them.</hi> This Covenant then, which God made with Iſrael, was for ſubſtance one with that he had made before with the Patriarks, that is, it was a Covenant of grace and mercy: though the Law, to them that reſted in the works thereof, and perverted the right uſe and end of the Law, was a killing letter and miniſtration of death.</p>

Further, never was mortall man more neer unto God, to whom for this end he is ſaid to appear face to face.

Secondly, with the people he prevailed to bind them in Covenant unto God, and make profeſſion of that obedience<note place="margin">Exod. 24. 4, 5, 6.</note> which the Lord did require and call for.

               <p>Fourthly, Eternall life is promiſed in the Covenant: for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living: and therefore the faithfull Jewes, which have God for their God doe live ſtill, not<note place="margin">Math. 22. 32. Math. 19. 17. Luk. 10. 25, 28.</note> in earth, but in heaven.

Not only long<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 12, 13.</note> life and good dayes, in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but eternall life is aſſured by the promiſe to them that keepe Covenant, as eternall death and deſtruction is comprehended under the curſe denounced againſt them that breake the Covenant.

Conſequent, when the condition is annexed to the promiſe as a qualification in the Subject, or an adjunct, that muſt attend the thing promiſed. And in this latter ſence, obedience to the Commandments, was a condition of the promiſe; not a cauſe why the thing promiſed was vouchſafed, but a qualification in the ſubject capable, or a conſequence of ſuch great mercy freely conferred.</p>
               <p>Of them that ſlip aſide and tranſgreſſe the Covenant, God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for and commandeth repentance, that is, it is his will and command, that they be thinke themſelves of their evill doings, confeſſe their iniquities, and turne unto the Lord. The frequent and earneſt exhortations of the Prophets made to backſliding and rebellious Iſrael, that ſhe ſhould acknowledge her wickedneſſe, and returne unto the Lord, is a full Commentary of that which<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 7, 22. &amp; 4. 1, 2. Ezek 18. 27, 28 Ezek. 18 31, 32. &amp; 33. 11, 13.</note> God required of them in this Covenant, in caſe they ſhould turne away from the holy Commandment. The Lord proteſteth by his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that he hath no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth; but rather that he ſhould repent and live: and the ſame for ſubſtance he made knowne to Iſrael in the Covenant which he ſtroke with them: <hi>ſc.</hi> that if they tranſgreſſe and goe aſtray, he doth admit, will accept and approve, nay command their unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and comming home unto the Lord, that they might live. This queſtion, <hi>Why will ye die, ye houſe of Iſrael!</hi> is put forth to the people in Covenant, and not indifferently to all and every man living: It is manifeſtly ſpoken of the houſe of Iſrael, whom God had ſpared, notwithſtanding their manifold and great provocations, to whom he not only gave ſpace of repentance, but uſed meanes to bring them to repentance, by ſending Prophets unto them to admoniſh them of their ſins, to denounce the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God againſt them for their impenitency, and earneſtly to exhort them to caſt away their tranſgreſſions, that they might live. God then doth approve, and command the returne of his people that have gone aſtray, he waiteth for their amendment, uſeth meanes to bring them to the knowledge of themſelves, is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them in any thing that in juſtice or promiſe he ought to doe
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55916:75"/> for them: but yet it is not his will effectually to bring every man to repentance, whom he doth command to repent. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God ſhews what is our duty, but not what God will worke in every man: the commandment lieth upon them that be obſtinate and rebellious, but they have not grace to will their converſion or amendment. Nevertheleſſe, we muſt not thinke, either that God doth diſſemble, or that he is the authour of mans impenitency: for mans corruption, pravity and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is the cauſe of his going on in evill; and his impotency, is not a meere infirmity, which he doth bewaile, but a ſtubborneſſe, which he doth foſter and cheriſh by all means.</p>
               <p>The condition of this Covenant (in the ſence afore-ſaid) is faith in the promiſed Meſſiah, which is implied in the promiſe, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> and commanded in the precept built upon it, <hi>Thou ſhalt have me to be thy God.</hi> For God is not the God of Iſrael, but in and through the Mediatour, neither can Iſrael take God to be their God, but by faith in the Meſſiah. In the Prophets we meet with no exhortations more common then theſe, <hi>Trust in the Lord, commit thy ſelfe unto the Lord, rowle thy burden upon him, leane upon the Lord:</hi> but what the Prophets exhort-unto, that is commanded in this expreſſure of the Covenant: and truſt in the Lord man a ſinner cannot, unleſſe it be in and through a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.

But all men will confeſſe the Iſraelites were by Covenant bound to ſeeke God, and pray unto him.

As God is one who ſhall juſtifie the circumciſion by faith, and the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55916:75"/> through faith: without queſtion in the Covenant of Grace he taught the Circumciſion to ſeek juſtification by faith, and not by the works of the Law. Nevertheleſſe herein God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for, and his Iſrael was bound to yeeld obedience to all his Commandements. Strict, exact, perfect obedience the Lord doth require, ſo that the leaſt failing muſt be acknowledged to be a ſin: uniforme and ſincere obedience is ſo required, that without it there can be no Salvation. Perfect obedience is commanded, that if a man will truſt in his works to be juſtified thereby, he muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring that which is every way compleat, or be caſt in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Sincere obedience, though imperfect is approved, that the imperfection of their beſt works being covered, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions graciouſly pardoned, they might be accepted by faith in Chriſt, who is the end of the Law, as righteous unto eternall life. This diſtinction was formerly propounded, but now is more largely to be confirmed.</p>
               <p>The Law requires perfect and exact obedience: for ſecret faults, even thoughts ariſing from corrupt nature, before they attained<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> full conſent, are therein condemned: and he that truſteth in his works, if he continue not in every thing that is written in the<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> book of the Law to doe them, he is accurſed. But to them that be in Covenant the Law was given with ſuch moderation, that ſincere obedience was accepted of them, though attended with<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 12, 13.</note> many imperfections, as is cleare by that of the Pſalmiſt, who can underſtand his errours, cleanſe thou me from ſecret faults, keep back thy ſervant alſo from preſumptuous ſinnes, let them not have dominion over me: then ſhall I be upright, and I ſhall be innocent from the great tranſgreſſion. The godly Governours and people of Iſrael were well acquainted with the meaning of the Law, and what obedience ſhould be accepted at their hands: And when<note place="margin">2 Kin. 23. 3. 2 Chro. 15. 12, 13, 14.

Therefore they underſtood the tenour of the Law as it was given unto them, to admit of upright, unfained and true obedience, the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that cleaveth unto their beſt works being graciouſly pardoned. <hi>I have ſworne, and I will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous</hi>

And hence it appeares what works the Apoſtle oppoſeth to faith in the matter of juſtification: not only perfect works done by the ſtrength of nature, of which ſort there be none at all: but works commanded in the Law as it was given to Iſrael, ſuch as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David</hi> walked in after they were effectually called, ſuch as without whoſe preſence faith it ſelf could not be exiſtent, ſuch as are neceſſary in the perſon juſtified: theſe works are oppoſed to faith, in the matter of juſtification, not that faith can be without them, but becauſe they cannot be cauſes together with faith in Juſtification. And of neceſſity, if faith be oppoſite to works ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly perfect, it muſt be oppoſite to them that are imperfect and ſtained in part, that be impurely pure: becauſe the Covenant of Grace calleth for perfection, though it accept ſincerity, and in all reaſon perfect righteouſneſſe ſhould rather be accepted for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe unto life, than that which is imperfect and falleth ſhort of that which is required.</p>

               <p>For the better adminiſtration of this ſtate and nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it pleaſed God to ordaine ſutable Ordinances for the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying of this Covenant, <hi>ſcil.</hi> of Miniſtery and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The firſt of theſe the Apoſtle openeth, ſetting down the ſtate of the Gentile and Jew before Chriſt came, compared both together, and how both ſtood in compariſon to the Church after Chriſt, in regard of this Ordinance of teaching. As the Gentile<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 23, 24, 25.</note> before Chriſt was a man conſtrained to live without a ſhelter: the Jew at the ſame time is better provided for: for he had the Law taught to cover his head in a ſtorme, that it be not too violent, But we after Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Gentiles before Chriſt ran wild like beggarly bruits without all ſchooling; the Jew a great deale better for the time being, he had a Schoole-maſter to teach and nourture him, even,<note place="margin">The Lord did thinke it good to ſet forth the ſtate of mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch kind of attires &amp; habiliments as might beſt ſuit with the fanſie of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority: and ſo to teach and clothe his Church with types and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which is a kind of Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the two the Jewes had more liberty in that kind, then Chriſtians in times of the Goſpell.</note> the Law to bring him unto Chriſt. But happy Chriſtians after Chriſt living in the Univerſity of the Church under the free Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of new Ordinances. The Schoolemaſterſhip of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a good Ordinance for the body of the people under Covenant with God, as we find this calling needfull and profitable in a Common-weale, though inferiour to the honour and worth of an Univerſity. There was not a man of them undiſcovenanted who took not benefit ſome way or other by this pedagogie. For ſome were kept thereby from notorious evils, as children that learne little at Schoole, get good in this, that they are kept from ſhrewd turnes. Others get much ability of knowledge, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looked at Chriſt; as ſome at Schoole learn to write and read, caſt account and make a bond, though they never intend any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of their learning. But the ſpirituall Jew got ſome true meaſure of grace to Salvation, though they reached not to that pitch and meaſure which is attaineable under the Ordinances of the New Teſtament; as in ſome good Grammar Schooles thoſe grounds of learning may be obtained, whereby men may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church or Common-weale in ſome meaſure, though they come not to that ripeneſſe and maturity, which may be gotten in the Univerſity.</p>
               <p>For the manner of this pedagogie under <hi>Moſes,</hi> we are not to conceive, that he taught his Schollers in things too hard for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55916:77"/> their capacity and practiſe only to ſet them to others to aske: for it is the part of a bad maſter to ſet his Schollars too hard a taske, that they might runne to their fellowes to make exerciſes, this is the way to non-proficiency. But <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Ceremoniall Ordinances did point out Chriſt, and ſo as a good Schoole-maſter directed unto him; and by ſhewing unto the Jewes their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inability, convincing them of ſinne, terrifying their conſciences, he did drive them unto Chriſt, and informed them how to walke being in Chriſt, that they might inherite the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Thus the Law entred that ſinne might abound, it diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 20. Gal. 3. 19. Rom. 7. 11. and 4. 15.</note> ſinne, wrought wrath, wounded, terrified and killed, and withall revealed the remedy to be had, not in the Law, but in Chriſt, that the diſtreſſed might not reſt in the Law, but ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and live. In a Schoole we muſt have rods to keep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory boyes in awe, and idle boyes to their bookes, according to the common Proverbe, <hi>A rod in a Schoole is alwayes in ſeaſon.</hi> This was found with <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Schoole, and uſed as occaſion was offered. The Ceremonies were as an hand-writing againſt<note place="margin">Col. 2. 14. Epheſ. 2. 15. The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are viſible words preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, and they preach guilt alſo and wrath belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unto us, by conſequent and to the Jew directly.

Schoole-maſters muſt have Apples and toyes to traine up boyes of better and ſofter natures, who be won with a Nut and loſt with the ſhell: This the Schoole of the Law wanted not in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as the outward temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life plentifully ſpoken too, and diſtributed by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> in his Booke: The Jewes were as Infants and little children that are much pleaſed with rattles and other toyes: and <hi>Moſes</hi> the rather to winne and keepe them in obedience, doth make large promiſes of corporall bleſſings and an earthly inheritance, as did befit the ſtate and condition of that people. But if theſe prevaile not, he hath his <hi>Ferula</hi> and gentle rod, which is the commination of temporall calamities and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be inflicted upon tranſgreſſours. It is expedient a Schoole-maſter have ſome other practiſes beſides Rods and Nuts to breake their wils, and make them corrigible and teachable, tractable and gentle, which the Law provided for aboundantly, having to doe with a ſtiffe-necked people, and ſtubborn Schollars. Three kinds of impoſitions <hi>Moſes</hi> propounded unto his Schollars to beare.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:55916:78"/>
               <p>Firſt, in the pedagogie of the Law he reſtrained them from ſome free creatures, whereunto they had ſtrange naturall deſires, as meats and drinks; making ſome uncleane: as mothers lay Apples before the eyes of their children, which yet they muſt not touch upon paine of a frowne, chiding or whipping, to breake their wils, and traine them up in obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He laid before them ſome other indifferencies, which if they did adventure to uſe, they muſt undergoe ſuch and ſuch hardſhip as was not worth the while: their injoyment not worth the paiment, as we reade <hi>Levit.</hi> 15. in many waſhings and purifications.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He preſcribed ſuch duties about the free creatures, which were dangerous, painfull and coſtly for the preſent, if it were poſſible to bow their uncircumciſed hearts: wherein he prevailed, and they profited aboundantly. In all which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their homage to God, more than at the firſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works with <hi>Adam,</hi> or in any former manifeſtation of this Covenant. And in theſe reſpects the Law might well be called a burden unſupportable, which neither the Jewes, nor their Fathers<note place="margin">Acts 15. 10.</note> were able to beare.</p>
               <p>A good Schoolemaſter will not ſcorne to teach rudiments to leſſer boyes, every letter and ſyllable: ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> and his ſucceſſors taught all the rudiments and legall precepts to all the Jewes, wherein though ſome ſticke as their furtheſt perfection, yet ſome went further to higher degrees, and all learned by them ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall obedience to draw on them and theirs ſome partiall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. Of this ſort were theſe, <hi>Touch not, taſt not.</hi> It beſeemes<note place="margin">Col. 2. 21.</note> an able Schoolemaſter ſo farre as he hath ability and authority to teach his Schollars Greeke, Hebrew, Logicke, principles of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er learning, eſpecially when an univerſity is not at hand: ſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in this pedagogie did riſe to teach higher things to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Iſrael, as the blood of Chriſt folded up in the blood of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, for the purging of their hearts from dead workes, and the mortification of ſinfull corruption in their burnt offerings, that ſo they might diſcover how they were delivered from the eternall curſe of the Law. Now when his ſpirituall Schollars felt the bondage of the Law, and came to learne the remedy, the very thing learned was their motive and reward, that they did not ſo much need rods or nuts, that is, the promiſe of temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55916:78"/> or denunciation of temporall judgements, and the want of ſuch learning was a ſmart rod to beate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo brought in the Prieſt-hood as a ſetled ordinance for that preſent, which for the perſons were to ſucceed him; The things which they had proper were two. Firſt to offer Sacrifices for the people and thereby to cleanſe them from the breach of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall commands put upon them by <hi>Moſes</hi> to teſtifie their homage. But the blood of thoſe ſacrifices, was a tipe of Chriſts<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 9. &amp; 10. 4. &amp; 9. 23.</note> blood our true and unchangeable high Prieſt, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is purged from the guilt of ſinne, and from all failings in the leaſt and higheſt degree of morall obedience. And though the carnall Jew ſaw it not in their ſacrifices, yet the ſpirituall, which brought a right ſence of ſinne and fitting diſpoſition, both ſaw it and reached pardon in theſe ſacrifices by faith in the blood of Chriſt tipified by them. And hence we ſee in what reſpect, the<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21. Heb. 8. 7. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and were partakers of the benefits thereof.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was the effect of this ordinance to offer up pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for the people upon their Incenſe. To runne into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular in this kind were infinite.</p>
               <p>The effect of this Covenant, that it bringeth forth children, but in ſome kind of bondage, preſſed and kept under with ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. <hi>For the heire ſo long as he is under Tutors and Governours dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth</hi>

But there is a twofold ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; one to damnation, which ſhuts the ſonnes of ſuch diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Kingdome of Heaven, which was figured by the bondage of <hi>Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar.</hi> This the Covenant doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in it ſelfe, but in them that rejected Chriſt the ſoule of the Law, and truſted in their workes to be juſtified thereby. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſonnes, which are held under the nourture of the Law and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55916:79"/> legall rites, but reſt not in them, but by them are led unto Chriſt; which abide ſtill in the houſe, and partake of the dignity of ſons though under Tutours; and this ſervitude is an effect of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thus adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>Under this Covenant the naturall ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> bore the face of the Church and ſtate, and God had promiſed abundance of temporals, and of ſpirituall a ſcantling: But all under the outward adminiſtration of the Covenant, were not in like manner parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the bleſſings promiſed in Covenant. For ſome had their part in the temporall bleſſings only, and the outward ordinances; others were partakers of the ſpirituall bleſſings promiſed. But whatſoever good thing any of them enjoyed either temporall or ſpirituall, it was conferred upon them freely according to the Covenant of Grace, and not for the dignity of their workes. It is true, the promiſe is conditionall, if they obey, they ſhall reape the good things of the Land: but obedience was not a cauſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, why they ſhould inherit, but conſequent, what they muſt doe when they ſhould inherit the Land. God would not that his people ſhould live diſſolutely in the promiſed Land: but he gave them not that inheritance for their righteouſneſſe. Certaine it is alſo, that God did reward partiall obedience with temporall bleſſings, as he ſpared ſome upon their temporary humiliation and fained repentance: and he permitted ſome obſtinate and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious to abide in the promiſed Land, and take roote and proſper for a ſeaſon: but this he did of his free bounty, that he might performe the Oath which he ſware unto the Fathers. So that herein there appeares no intexture of the Covenant of workes with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, nor any moderation of the Law to the ſtrength and power of nature for the obtaining of outward bleſſings. But rather that God of his aboundant goodneſſe is pleaſed freely to conferre outward bleſſings promiſed in Covenant upon ſome that did not cleave unto him unfainedly, that he might make good his promiſe unto the ſpirituall ſeed, which by word and oath he had confirmed unto the Fathers. In this expreſſion of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it pleaſed God to add unto the former, another ſeal for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their faith, ſc. the Paſſe-over which was a tipe of<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 1 Cor. 5. 7.</note> Chriſt, the immaculate Lambe of God, which taketh away the ſinnes of the world; ourtrue Paſſe-over, who was ſacrificed for us, as well as a ſeale of their deliverance from the bondage of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:55916:79"/> And the celebration of the Paſſeover, was as a gratefull remembrance of their moſt powerfull and gracious deliverance from the fiery fornace, and conſequently of their poſſeſſion of that good Land, which the Lord had promiſed to give them: ſo was it a teſtimony of their faith in the bloud of Chriſt, whereby they were ſet free from the powers of darkneſſe, and the curſe of the Law, and reſtored into ſpirituall liberty, being made heires of the kingdome of heaven. And from all this we may ſee, wherein this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Covenant doth exceed the former, and wherein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from, and fals ſhort of the new Covenant: of which in the latter end of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>This Covenant that God made with <hi>David</hi> is everlaſting, that is unchangeable: becauſe the gifts and calling of God is without repentance.

               <p>The condition of this Covenant is, that they ſhould walke in the wayes of the Lord, and keepe his watch; take heed to the charge of the Lord their God, and keepe his ſtatutes and his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his judgements, and his teſtimonies; to walke before the Lord in truth, with all their ſoules. <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers that he forſake us not, nor leave us: That he may bow our hearts unto him, that we may walke in all his wayes, and keepe his Commandements, and his Statutes, and his Lawes, which he commanded our Fathers.</hi> Particularly, <hi>He that ruleth over men,</hi> that is, the Iſraelites, <hi>must be juſt, ruling in the feare of God.</hi> And thus it is obſerved of <hi>David,</hi> That <hi>he f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To the ſpirituall houſe of <hi>David,</hi> ſo to ſpeake, was promiſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne, adoption, comfort, joy, and an heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; all this was made good, for God freely called them by his Spirit, and by his power kept them by faith unto Salvation. Though the houſe of <hi>David</hi> loſt the Kingdome and government in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet God preſerved his poſterity untill Chriſt came, in whom the throne of <hi>David</hi> was eſtabliſhed for ever: for this was abſolutely promiſed. But the temporall glory of <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, and the peace of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was changed, becauſe they changed the ordinances, neglected the charge, and brake the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. <hi>If his ſonnes forſake my Law, and walke not in my</hi>

They were ſlaine with the ſword, burnt up with famine, languiſhed through oppreſſion, miſery and ſorrow, had in contempt and deriſion daily, but there was none to pittie or comfort them. Nevertheleſſe, the promiſe of God was firme and ſure to all the ſeed, in reſpect of the things abſolutely promiſed, for the infidelity of man cannot make the faith of God of none effect.</p>
               <p>Hence we learne, two things are to be conſidered in the Covenant, 1. The perſons in Covenant according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall adminiſtration, or according to the effectuall purpoſe and internall adminiſtration. 2. The good things promiſed not only temporall, but ſpirituall. For they are either ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, or ſuch as concerne the welfare of a Chriſtian, his peace, joy, chearfull and conſtant walking with God without offence, and ſuch like. To the firſt ſort, the promiſes of the Covenant are made ſincerely, but conditionally, If they doe well they ſhall be accepted; if they conſent and obey, they ſhall inherit the good things of the Land. To the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually called, all other promiſes are made abſolutely, or at leaſt ſhall abſolutely be made good, becauſe God will give them to doe what he requireth. Effectuall calling is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It is wrought freely, effectually, certainly, but when, where and as the Lord will, not conditionally, nor according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to this or that perſon. God promiſeth he will preſerve his Church, and uphold the ſeed of <hi>David:</hi> but to this or that perſon God hath not promiſed, that he ſhall be brought home, or gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the flock. The Covenant made preſuppoſeth man called, and taking hold of the Covenant, it doth not promiſe that he ſhall be effectually wrought upon, and powerfully drawne to lay hould upon the promiſe. Faith is the gift of God, which he giveth as
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55916:85"/> he pleaſeth: but to the believer he aſſureth all other neceſſary good things, with continuance in faith, according to his free Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Of good things ſpirituall there be two ſorts, as was ſaid, ſome abſolutely neceſſary, as faith, repentance, pardon of ſinne, perſeverance, eternall life, and theſe are all moſt certainly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and aſſuredly conferred. And though Juſtification and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life be conditionall, promiſed unto and ſo beſtowed upon the unfained beleever: yet may they be called abſolute, becauſe God giveth to the man in Covenant every thing neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Other things are good in themſelves and profitable, as joy and chearfulneſſe of heart, deliverance from ſcandalous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull evils, wounding conſcience, and grieving the Spirit. And theſe are not promiſed, nor evermore beſtowed upon the faithfull. <hi>David</hi> may be an inſtance hereof; He was not preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſinne-waſting conſcience, and ſtaining the ſoul, but was recovered from the danger thereof. To repent of the ſinne, and to be pardoned of free grace, was neceſſary to Salvation, God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vouchſafed this ſure mercy unto him. To be kept from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was not of that neceſſity, God therefore ſuffered him to fall to cure pride of heart, make him know himſelf, and magnifie the riches of his grace in his recovery.</p>
               <p>This is evident from this, that in the Covenant as the Lord promiſed mercy, which he performed, ſo he threatned judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſtruction againſt them that did diſobey, if they perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted obſtinate and would not returne. And therefore both in ſhewing mercy, and inflicting puniſhment, the Lord dealt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to promiſe. Sometimes when the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Lord ſpared them, but then he gave them hearts to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, and ſo the judgement was prevented. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ye have forſaken me, therefore have I alſo left you in the</hi>

The Prophet and Apoſtle both ſpeake of a lively faith, which is effectuall to bring forth good works: but we obtain life eternall by faith, and not by works. To live here is to obtaine life or glory, not to leade our life according to the Law, or rule of righteouſneſſe: as the drift of the Prophet, and Expoſition of the Apoſtle, oppoſing the life which is by faith, to that which is by the works of the Law, which could not be, if to live by faith had been to direct our life according to the Law. Though then the righteous man muſt exerciſe himſelfe in righteouſneſſe, yet he is juſtified and liveth, that is, obtaineth life eternall by faith, and not by the works of faith.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, in the very tenour and adminiſtration of the Covenant it ſelfe it did excell. For this Covenant after it once began, did continue without interruption, untill it was perfected by the New Teſtament properly ſo called, whereas the former Covenant was broken or did expire. For during the time of the Babyloniſh
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55916:89"/> Captivity, neither <hi>Judah</hi> nor <hi>Iſrael</hi> had either wandering Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 6, 7.</note> or ſtanding Temple: But in this Covenant, God did ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> in the building of the Temple, that he brought forth<note place="margin">Zach. 4. 7. ver 9.</note> the head ſtone thereof with ſhoutings, crying, <hi>Grace, Grace unto it;</hi> He laid the foundation of the houſe, and his hands alſo fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it: and the Lord ſo preſerved it, that it continued untill Chriſt taking our nature upon him, came and dwelt amongſt his people. <hi>I will ſhake all Nations, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come,</hi>

                  <hi>and I will fill this houſe with glory, ſaith the Lord of Hosts. The ſilver is mine, and the gold is mine, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.

                  <hi>ſhall ſay, ſurely our Fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein there is no profit. Behold I will gather them out of all Countries, whether I have driven them in mine anger, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 11. 17, 18, 19. Eze. 20. 40, 41, 42, 43. Lam. 4. 22.

                  <hi>in my fury, and in great wrath, and I will bring them againe into this place, and I will cauſe them to dwell ſafely: And they ſhall be my people, and I will be their God. And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may feare me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them. And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to doe them good: but I will put my feare into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And in theſe reſpects, this Covenant which pertained to the old Teſtament might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an inchoation of the new: becauſe the old ordinances diſtilling grace in ſome meaſure into the whole Covenant, were to continue, untill Chriſt ſhould be incarnate, and erect a new Tabernacle, which ſhould ſtand and continue for ever: when a new people ſhould be added to the Lord, and the old ordinances, becauſe of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, being taken downe, a new forme ſhould be ſet up, to abide for ever.</p>
               <p>And from all this, we may briefly obſerve in what accidents the old and new Teſtament differ one from another, when for ſubſtance they be one and the ſame. They both flow from the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55916:90"/> free-grace and mercy of God looking at poore ſinners in Jeſus Chriſt. They have both one common matter: the obedience of<note place="margin">Heb. 5, 8. Act. 3. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Eph. 1. 14.</note> faith required, and life everlaſting, and all ſecondary good things promiſed by the imputation of the righteouſneſſe of faith, and free adoption in Jeſus Chriſt. They have both one object Jeſus Chriſt, who being promiſed to the Fathers in propheticall Scriptures, God hath in due time exhibited under the Goſpel. They have both one generall end, <hi>viz.</hi> the praiſe of the glorious grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Both Covenants are ſtruck with man-kind, as inveſted in one and the ſame reall and formall conſideration, whither before or after Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſinners, and thoſe which worke not, but beleeve in him that juſtifieth the ungodly. In both the ſame ſpirit ſealed up the truth of the Covenants to all under Covenant: for ſeeing the adoption, and inheritance in ſome meaſure belonged to the Fathers in the old Teſtament, the earneſt of that inheritance cannot be denied them. But the new Covenant doth in many things out-ſtrip the old, which do nothing derogate from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall and reall unity and agreement.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In the old Teſtament the Lord did proclaime himſelf to be mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger, aboundant in goodneſſe and truth, which he confirmed by great and wonderfull deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his people out of Egypt and Babylon: but yet at firſt he gave his Law with ſignes of Majeſty, glory and terrour, yea of anger and diſpleaſure againſt ſin and wickedneſſe. But the new<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 18. Heb. 12. 21, 22, 23. Eph 2 17, 18. 2 Cor. 5. 17, 18.</note> Teſtament was given with manifeſt tokens of love, favour and free mercy, God being reconciled in the Son of his love, and therein he hath revealed his ſuperaboundant and tranſcendent love, mercy and long ſuffering, as ſhall be ſhewed hereafter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the old Teſtament Chriſt was knowne to be the ſeed of the woman, the ſelected ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> his bloud and death typified in <hi>Moſes,</hi> his perſon and office, humiliation and reſurrection fore-told by the Prophets, but all theſe were more obſcure and darke to the Jewes: but in the new Teſtament<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 12, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. Rom. 1. 4. Gal. 3. 19. 2 Co. 1. 20</note> he is openly manifeſted to be the Son of God, made unto us of God wiſdom, righteouſnes, ſanctification and redemption, to whom the promiſe was made, and by whoſe love &amp; authority, as the great Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator of heaven, they are all made, put forth, ratified &amp; eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The commandments of the old Teſtament were many<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 16. Col. 2. 14, 15.</note> of them carnall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtanding in ceremoniall obſervances, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55916:90"/> an hand-writing againſt them: and the promiſes were many corporall, as of an earthly inheritance, ſo that by them their faith was to aſcend up to ſpirituall and heavenly things, and the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall promiſes were obſcure, in number fewer, and ſuch as were farre off. But the commandments of the new Covenant are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> and the promiſes ſpirituall, plainly revealed, nigh at hand, ratified by the comming of Chriſt, particular: earthly things are promiſed as an additament to them that ſeek the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and included in the ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Mediatour of the old Teſtament, a<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19.</note> typicall, imperfect Mediatour, as not a right middle perſon; a<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 15. 8. 8. 6. &amp; 12. 14.</note> Mediatour in reſpect of the outward adminiſtration, and that by the power and vertue of Chriſt, but the force of that Covenant had foundation in Chriſt, and it was in and through Chriſt, that the federates were partakers of the good things promiſed. But Chriſt the Mediatour of the new Covenant, a true and perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, a right middle perſon between God and man; who hath revealed the Goſpel, ſatisfied revenging juſtice, brought in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſſe: who alone is able to remove the guilt of ſin from the conſcience, repaire the loſt image of God in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, bow their hearts to walk in obedience, and procure acceptance to their ſervice.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The old Teſtament was confirmed with the bloud of<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 18, 19, 20. Heb. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14. Mat. 26. 28.</note> beaſts, becauſe the typicall Mediatour was not Teſtator, and ſo was not to die: but in the new Teſtament the true and perfect Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, was alſo the Teſtator, and ſo the Covenant was confirmed by his precious bloud.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Law was written in tables of ſtone, yet ſo as it was<note place="margin">Exod. 31. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Deut. 9. 10. Deut. 30. 6, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 2 Cor. 3. 5. Jer. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10.</note> engraven in the tables of the heart, though not in that plenty and abundance that afterward: for under the old Teſtament God would have both letter and ſpirit, but more letter and leſſe ſpirit. But the Goſpel is written in the fleſhie tables of the heart, yet ſo as it is committed to writing: for in the new Teſtament the Lord would have both letter and ſpirit, but more ſpirit and leſſe letter then in the old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The old Covenant was made with one ſelected Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though Proſelites, if any offered themſelves, might not be excluded; but in the new Covenant, the world in oppoſition to<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT hath often been ſaid, that God accepteth true, unfained and upright obedience, and when the ſervants of God intreat mercy, we find they alleadge the truth, uprightneſſe, and integrity of their hearts, to ſhew they were rightly qualified to make a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plea for mercy: therefore (I conceive) it will not be out of place here to ſhew what Truth and Uprightneſſe is, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the doctrine of the new Covenant.</p>

And injuſtice is oppoſed to truth, and iniquity or unrighteouſneſſe put for falſhood or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: the Mammon of iniquity, that is, deceitfull riches, is ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the true treaſure, which will not deceive. <hi>Iniquity was not found in his mouth,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, that is, guile or deceit.

But though the thing be one for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that is ſignified by all theſe, and they be ſometimes uſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, yet they note formall and diſtinct conceits, and ſo may be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Truth implieth or preſuppoſeth theſe things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Knowledge of Gods will. Truth of judgement goeth before<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 12.</note> truth of heart: for corrupt doctrine is as ſowre leaven, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth the whole maſſe, maketh the whole to ſavour of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Soundneſſe or ſolidity in grace, oppoſite to thoſe ſuperficiall and ſhallow-planted graces, that may be found in temporary Chriſtians, enduring but for a time. This is truth in the reines or<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 6.</note> inward parts, which ſeaſoneth the heart throughout, and makes it true, whereas the heart of the temporary is falſe and unſound; becauſe his graces are ſuperficially or ſleightly rooted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sincerity or godly ſimplicity without fraud, craft or guile, where the in-ſide and out-ſide are one, the heart and mouth equall and well conſenting. Truth is an ingenuous life without deceit and diſſimulation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 15. Holineſſe of truth is true or ſincere holineſſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 24. To keepe the truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 2. is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace true piety and true vertue without hypocriſie, without lying, or perfidiouſneſſe. To ſerve God in truth, <hi>Joſh. 24. 14. 1 Sam.</hi> 12. 24. is to ſerve God unfainedly, from the heart, according to his<note place="margin">1 King. 2. 4.</note> will. To walke in the truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 4. is to walke ſincerely or in godly ſimplicity. For truth is ingenuous, void of ſimulation. And in this ſence ſome underſtand that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in the truth,</hi> that is, love ſincerely or in truth rejoyceth<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 6.</note>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:55916:92"/> with them that rejoyce. Truth is oppoſed to lying and falſhood, and to empty ſhadows and rites: and thus it may be applied to<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 25. Joh. 4. 23, 24.</note> this purpoſe, as noting a plaine ſimplicity contrary to lying and emptie ſhews. To ſtay upon God in truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 20. is unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, and not in word to ſtay upon him. To preach Chriſt in truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18. is ſincerely to preach him: A true heart is ſingle, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 46. reſolved not in ſome things, but in all to walk with God, or as the Lord hath appointed. Thus a true Chriſtian hath but one mind, one intention, one delight, one face, one tongue; he is all but one man, all the powers of the ſoule goe but one way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Purity, or cleare ſhining innocency in all things, free from the mixture of leaven in manners or doctrine. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writeth to the diſperſed Jewes, to ſtirre up their pure minds:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 1.</note> what is that, but minds furniſhed and ſeaſoned with an holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity of truth. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that they<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9. 10.</note> might abound in all knowledge and in all judgement, that they might be able to diſcerne things that differ, that they might be ſincere. And the ſame Apoſtle teſtifieth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he was afraid of them, leſt their mind ſhould be corrupted from the<note place="margin">

                     </gap> Cor. 11. 3.</note> ſimplicity that is in Chriſt. The word uſed by the Apoſtle in all three places ſignifieth properly ſomething tried by the light of the Sunne. And it is a Metaphor (as ſome ſuppoſe) taken from the cuſtome of the Eagle, whoſe manner is (if we may beleeve thoſe that write the naturall ſtory) to bring her young out of the neſt before they be full fledge, and to hold them forth againſt the full ſight of the Sun; the ſight whereof thoſe of them that can with open eye endure, ſhe retaineth and bringeth up as her owne; the reſt that cannot brooke it, and winke at it, ſhe rejecteth and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth off as a baſtardly brood. Others thinke it rather taken from the uſuall practiſe of Chap-men in the view and choice of their wares. A wiſe wary Chap-man that hath to doe with a deceitfull Merchant, Draper or other, one that keepeth his wares in obſcure places, where the defects of them cannot ſo eaſily be diſcerned, or hath falſe lights, that may helpe to give a counterfeit gloſſe to them, he will take no ware of him upon his word, but he will firſt diligently view it, toſſe it and turne it to and fro, over and over, try how it is in the midſt, as well as at both ends, bring it forth into the light, hold up his cloth againſt the Sun, ſee if he can eſpie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55916:92"/> any defect or default in it, he knoweth he may eaſily elſe be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reached. The like muſt be our practiſe in all matters of faith and<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 17.</note> manners: and this is to walk in the truth, when we have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation honeſt, and hold the truth of Doctrine purely, as we may endure the tryall of the light. Thus the Apoſtle joyneth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth together, as one and the ſame, or as the ſpeciall<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 8. 2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> and generall, ſincerity being a branch of truth. This is our comfort, that in ſimplicity and ſincerity of God, that is, godly ſincerity, we have had our converſation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Firmeneſſe and conſtancy in every holy duty of our generall or perſonall calling, of piety or righteouſneſſe. A faithfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſtedfaſt with God: the ground of declining is lacke of truth. Their <hi>heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfast in</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 78. 8. Pſal. 78. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>his Covenant.</hi> If the heart be not true, what ſhew ſoever a man makes, he is but like an Apple, rotten at the coare, or as an houſe built upon the ſand, the one of which, though beautifull, will ſoon putrifie, the other, though fairly ſet, will quickly fal. A man may have many worthy gifts, but if he want ſincerity, upon a ſudden may be taken from him, both that which he hath, and that which he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to have, &amp; his end be as the fig-tree, which making only a ſhew with leaves, having no fruit, being curſed, loſt even thoſe alſo, and withered away by degrees, being good for nothing but the fire. For as a ſtomack ill affected with choller, though never ſo wholeſome meats be received into it, yet it cannot hold them, but is provoked: ſo where there is this obſtruction of the ſoul, the wilfull love of any ſinfull courſe, or ſubordination of grace to boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, diſtempered, earthly paſſions, pleaſures or profits, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever grace is received into the heart, it will not let it reſt, but maketh the ſoul caſt it up upon all occaſions. Truth and ſoundneſſe is the preſerver of grace received: an honeſt and ſound heart is as a veſſel well cloſed, it will keep and hold the liquour of grace that is powred into it. The courſe of a true Chriſtian is permanent, and continueth unto the end.</p>
               <p>This truth or ſinceritie, is the girdle, whereby all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are tied cloſe unto us. So the Apoſtle in the deſcription<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 14.</note> of the ſpirituall armour, calleth it the girdle of truth. And therefore here alſo that is true of all men, which we ſay of children in the Proverbe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngirt, unblest.</hi> This girdle hath theſe uſes.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:55916:93"/>
               <p>Firſt, It doth adorne us: for this was the uſe of the ſtudded belt, which the Souldiers did weare to hide the gaping of the joynts of their armour, which would have been unſeemly: and nothing doth more adorne a ſoule, beautifie our actions, or raiſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, then ſincerity; as our Saviour commending <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> gave this ſpeech of him, <hi>Behold, a true Iſraelite in whom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 47.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, A girdle doth tie other clothes about us, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the winds would blow abroad, and would hang but looſe upon us: ſo this girdle of truth doth containe and hold toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all other graces, wherewith the ſoule is arraied, and unleſſe truth doe keepe them together, in time all of them will be blowne away with the wind of temptation. That grace which was not knit together with honeſty of heart, came to nothing in the end, as appeares in the Parable. The body, when the ſoule is once gone, may not long ſtay above ground, it muſt needs be buried. The hypocrites graces are but the body of grace, they want the ſoul and life, which is ſincerity, and we cannot thinke they ſhould long endure. An unſound horſe, that hath ſome ſecret fault, may carry as good a ſhew as the ſoundeſt, and at firſt for a mile or two, trav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, A girdle truſſing up the loins moderately, doth ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a man, a girdle is put for ſtrength and ornament, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23. 10. for in the loines is the ſeat of ſtrength and might, and with a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the loines are girded; whence are theſe phraſes, <hi>I will ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him with thy girdle,</hi> Iſa. 22. 21. <hi>Justice ſhall be the girdle of his loynes,</hi> Iſa. 11. 5. <hi>He girdeth their loynes with a girdle,</hi> Job 12. 18. <hi>and looſeth the girdle of the ſtrong,</hi> Job 12. 21. <hi>She gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up her loynes with ſtrength,</hi> Prov. 31. 17. And the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo often uſed. <hi>Gird up thy loynes,</hi> Jer. 1. 17. Job. 38. 3. &amp; 40. 7. 2 King. 4. 29. &amp; 2 King 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. So this grace addeth great ſtrength to the inner man, as we may ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> who when God ſeemed, and men did fight againſt him, when heaven and earth ſeemed to conſpire againſt him, yet this did ſtick by him, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill I die, I will never take away mine innocency from my ſelfe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 27. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the Eaſterne Countries, where they were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55916:93"/> to weare long garments down to the ancles, they uſed to gird them cloſe unto their body, when they had any journey, combate<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 11.</note> or labour in hand, leaſt they ſhould be an impediment unto them. So they were commanded to eat the Paſſeover with their loines girded, becauſe they had a journey to goe, and <hi>Elias</hi> girded up<note place="margin">1 King. 18. 46.</note> his loines, and ran before <hi>Ahab.</hi> And ſo to have loynes girt, is to be fitted and prepared for any ſervice, travell or conflict; <hi>Let</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 4. Luk. 17. 8. Luk. 12. 35, 37. 1 Pet. 1. 13. Act. 12. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>your loynes be girded about, and your lights burning. Gird up the loynes of your mind, and be ſober. Gird thy ſelfe and bind on thy ſandales.</hi> Thus Chriſtians girded with truth, are in readineſſe for any ſpirituall duty, and to encounter with whatſoever adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary power ſhall with-ſtand them in the courſe of godlineſſe. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure at the firſt putting on, this garment may ſeem ſomewhat ſtraight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing eaſie to weare: but he that is accuſtomed to goe girded, ſhall find ſuch eaſe in it, ſuch comfort by it, that he can never be well without it, never at eaſe, untill it be put on. Truth of heart is bleſſed of God with increaſe of grace. This is it which maketh the leaſt portion of grace to thrive in the hands of Gods children. Their faithfulneſſe in a little, brings them to be<note place="margin">Luk. 19. 17.</note> owners of a great deale, and to be rulers over much. This brought ſuch a plentifull bleſſing upon the ſmall beginnings of <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> to whom Chriſt, becauſe of his truth in the inward affections, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed an enlarged meaſure of enlightning, and that he ſhould ſee greater things. This brought ſuch a comfortable encreaſe upon the dimme knowledge of the Eunuch and <hi>Cornelius;</hi> they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 47, 50.</note> God in truth of heart, according to the meaſure of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had received, and in them the promiſe was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:</hi> they were led further into that great myſterie of godlineſſe, an Evangeliſt being ſent of God to the one, and both an Angell and an Apoſtle to the other. A true hearted Chriſtian is carefull to get, charie to keepe, and warie to husband, what grace hee hath received, and how ſhould hee not then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe from one meaſure to another? Not that a ſecond grace is given for the right uſe of the firſt, but that the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace is ſuch, that one drawes another, and for a firſt given a latter is freely beſtowed alſo, in which continuation of grace, the right uſe of grace proceeding from it, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:55916:94"/>
               <p>Sincerity is ſtrengthened of God to be a meanes of comfort to a mans ſoule in his greateſt diſtreſſes. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was arreſted with the ſentence of death by the mouth of the Prophet, here was his comfort, and that which imboldened him to looke death in the face with more courage; <hi>O Lord thou knoweſt,</hi> or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">Iſa. 38. 3.

So <hi>Paul</hi> in the midſt of all his ſorrowes, this is his rejoycing, not ſimply that he had preached, that he had planted Churches, wrought miracles, converted ſinners, made Satan to fall downe from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven like lightening: but that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity he had his converſation in the world.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This puts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a kind of heroicall ſpirit, and Lyon-like boldneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of God in the greateſt tryalls. Hereupon <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 3.</note> was reſolute not to paſſe for mans judgement. Faith depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the meere grace of God, and his free promiſe: but the truer any mans heart is unto God, the more bold and confident is he of the Lords ſupport and comfort, which alone adds undaunted courage in all temptations.</p>

God is the God of truth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 5.<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 7. Jer. 30. 21.</note> Chriſt is truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. the ſpirit is the ſpirit of truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 17. Truth is one ſpeciall branch of that Image of God according<note place="margin">Epheſ. 23, 24. 2 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 18.</note> to which man was made. And the greater meaſure of truth in the inward parts, the more are we (to ſpeake with the Apoſtle) changed into the Image of God. And the more we reſemble God and have communion with him, the more is our affinity with him. Satan ever did, and ſtill oppoſeth ſincerity by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, opprobries, and reproaches, as of pride, hypocriſie, diſſimulation, ſpecially when God afflicteth his people, <hi>Job.</hi> 2. 6, 9. But the more Satan oppoſeth truth and ſimplicity, the more ſhould we be in love with it: for Satan would not loade it with diſgraces if it were not excellent. Satan labours to foiſt in the leaven of hypocriſie in our daily courſe, that by little and little he might pick the good ſeed of righteouſneſſe out of our hearts, but our care muſt be to diſappoint him. Here our reſiſtance is to hold us to our owne, and pray to God to rebuke him.</p>
               <p>And here to prevent miſtaking we muſt diſtinguiſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſoundneſſe and ſimplicity, and the nature of it. In nature the ſoundnes of the godly is true, but in degree weake and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and therfore now and then through frailtie and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the performance of good duties they looke more at man then at God, and propound indirect meanes when they ſhould eye his glory only. But as we ſay of other ſinnes, ſo of hypocriſy, it is either raigning, or not. In the hearts of true Chriſtians there may be hypocriſie, but not raigning hypocriſie. <hi>David</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he, in whoſe ſpirit there is no guile,</hi> did take himſelfe<note place="margin">Pſal. 32 2.</note>

But ſinne that raigneth not, muſt not diſcourage: and if we have an unfained purpoſe againſt it, if we grieve for it, if we ſeeke for ſtrength againſt it, it reigneth not.</p>
               <p>The effect or evidence of a ſound heart is, that being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the truth of God, he doth heartily reſigne himſelfe to be guided and directed by the Lord, in all things. As <hi>Paul</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 10.</note> in behalfe of the <hi>Philippians, that they might approve things that are excellent, that they might be ſincere, and without offence till the day of Chriſt.</hi> And it is noted of <hi>Ezra, that he prepared his heart to ſeeke the Law of the Lord, and to doe it: and to teach in Iſrael, Statutes</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and Judgements.</hi> And from this generall ſpring divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Truth breeds an hatred of all falſe and corrupt opinions in Doctrine: becauſe ſound affections require good judgement and true underſtanding, and if the underſtanding that ſhould guide and governe the inferiour powers be perverted with errour, the heart muſt needs move out of order. <hi>Folly is joy to him that is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 15 21.</note> 
                  <hi>of wiſedome, but a man of underſtanding walketh uprightly,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth himſelfe ſtraite in walking: He can never ſhoote ſtraight, that takes his aime contrary. The voice of a true heart ſoundeth thus in <hi>David, I hate vaine thoughts, but thy Law doe I love. I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 113, 128.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, It hath in deteſtation all falſe and deviſed worſhip, which is nothing but lying pompe and vanity. <hi>Ephraim compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me about with lies, and the houſe of Iſrael with deceit.</hi> Truth<note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 12.</note> ſeeke neerenes and acquaintance with God: but in deviſed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip no comfort or profit is to be found: rather the heart is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Math. 15. 9. Iſa. 29. 14.</note> from God, when men draw nigh to him with their lips.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It worketh an univerſall hatred of all ſinne, that is, of ſecret as well as open ſinnes, of leſſer ſinnes as well as of greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, of ſuch ſinnes as where unto we have ſpeciall inticements by ſome particular content or profit, which they ſeeme to promiſe, as well as of thoſe which afford neither gaine, credit, nor plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. A true heart hath a coſtant purpoſe in no one thing, willingly to ſinne againſt God, but rather to indeavour the uttermoſt in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55916:96"/> good way of Gods commandements. And as he ſtands reſolved againſt all ſinne in generall, both ſimply conſidered, and in reſpect of all occurrences, whereby he might be allured or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: ſo in ſpeciall againſt the ſinne to which he finds himſelfe moſt inclined, or where-with he hath at any time been overtaken. <hi>Incline not my heart to any evill thing, to practiſe wicked workes with</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 4</note> 
                  <hi>men that worke iniquity: and let me not eate of their dainties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is joyned with a readineſſe of mind to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and lay open every ſinne as ſoone as it is knowne to be ſinne; and a gladneſſe to have the conſcience ranſacked and ripped up, that whatſoever is ſinfull may be found out. <hi>David</hi> ſpake it out of experience, when he pronounced the man bleſſed, in whoſe<note place="margin">Pſal. 32. 2.</note> ſpirit there is no guile: Now this was a branch of that ſpirituall guile, that he once thought to helpe himſelfe in evill doing, by holding his tongue; as who would ſay he would forget it, and paſſe it over: but he was never well, till he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of that falſe trick, and fell to the down-right acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his ſinne; he never had comfort till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed againſt himſelfe his wickedneſſe. This he writes for a patterne, and gives his Pſalme a title accordingly; To give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: and this experience taught him to intreat the Lord to pry into him, as fearing himſelfe that he ſhould deale ſomewhat<note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 23; 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> over-favourably with himſelfe. <hi>Try me, O Lord, and know mine heart: prove me, and know my thoughts, and conſider if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me:</hi> and to profeſſe himſelfe not only willing to beare, but deſirous to be reprehended, if he ſhould ſtep awry. <hi>Let</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 5,</note> 
                  <hi>the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſſe: and let him reprove me, it ſhall be an excellent oyle, which ſhall not breake my head: for yet my prayer alſo ſhall be in their calamities,</hi> or, by how much he ſhall doe that the more, by how much they ſhall reprove me the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, by ſo much I ſhall pray the more fervently for them. When a man loves not thoſe meanes which tend to the diſcovery of his heart and life, and to the finding out of his ſecret ſinnes, or reprehenſions whether publike or private, or ſerious and earneſt confeſſion of ſin before God, there is great cauſe to ſuſpect that all is not ſound within.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Truth dealeth not only againſt this or that branch of corruption, which ſhooteth out to our diſgrace or trouble, but againſt the root it ſelfe. As in <hi>Paul</hi> we ſee, the Law of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55916:97"/> evill which did dwell within him, was his principall matter of conflict.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, It zealouſly contendeth for the maintainance of Gods pure worſhip and ſervice. <hi>Judah ruleth with the Lord, and is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſ. 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>with the holy One. Judah</hi> retaineth the pure worſhip of God, whoſe ſervice is perfect freedome, and the trueſt dominion: for he that ſerveth the Lord purely, hath rule over Satan and his own unruly luſts.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In all ſervice the true Chriſtian ſtrives to approve his heart unto God, and to performe it as in his preſence, to the<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 19. 1 Cor. 14. 15. Rom. 6. 17. 2 Cor. 2. 17.</note> glory of his name. He prayeth with the Spirit, obeyeth from the heart, heares with reverence, ſpeakes as in the ſight of God, and doth all things with life and power.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, In all conditions or eſtates of life, in all dealings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or open, publike or private, at home or abroad, he will carry himſelf as becomes the Goſpell, and ſtudy to be harmeleſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and without rebuke before God and man. <hi>Doe all things without murmurings and disputings: That ye may be blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>and harmleſſe, the Sonnes of God without rebuke.</hi> Thus a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſervant will ſhew all diligence in his Maſters buſineſſe, as<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 6, 7. Col. 3. 22, 23. Tit. 2. 10. Dan. 6. 4.</note> well abſent as preſent, froward or courteous; and all faithfulneſſe in things committed to his charge, even to the leaſt pinne, though he might doe otherwiſe with ſecrecy and ſecurity from men; and that willingly, of conſcience, and not for hope of credit or gaine. And not ſo only, but he will reverence his Maſter, and in heart be that unto him, which he ſeemeth to be in carriage, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back which he is before his face. A Chriſtian man will be ſimple, plaine, and juſt in all his dealings, inoffenſive in matters of Religion, loving and courteous in all his behaviour, and what he would ſeeme to be towards others in their preſence, that he is inwardly, and in their abſence.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, True grace is permanent, and ſound Chriſtians are conſtant in their courſe, not ſhrinking in temptation, not ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide like a broken bow. An hypocrite is wavering in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of occurrences, halting and divided in reſpect of objects; in ſubjection to inordinate paſſions, powerleſſe in the performance of holy duties, wiſe to hide and cover ſinne, glorious in empty ſhewes of Religion, apt for advantage to ſwallow leſſer ſinnes without ſtraining, ſlippery in earthly dealings, aiming at wrong
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55916:97"/> ends in the profeſſion of the truth, indulgent to his beloved and darling ſinnes, deſirous to ſeeme religious, though he much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the power of godlineſſe. But the true Chriſtian is unlike him in all theſe reſpects: He is ſound and conſtant, a maſter of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, a bungler to colour or guild over ſinne, deſirous to be good, and in every thing anſwerable to his profeſſion, faithfull in his place, plaine in his dealings, innocent and harmeleſſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the child of God; the ſame man at home and abroad, within and without, openly and in ſecret, in thought and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. This is that truth and ſincerity which the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth, and the godly ſtrive after, and obtaine in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

Pſal. 33. 1. 1 Ki.</hi> 3. 6. are joyned together as in ſubſtance noting the ſame thing. So that uprightneſſe cannot be taken negatively for the want of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe only, but poſitively for truth, and righteouſneſſe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is equivalent to both. For the Greeke ſtraight, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 4, 5. the Syriac Interpreter uſeth a word that ſignifieth equall, poliſhed, ſmoothed, made even or pure, comming of a root that is to poliſh or make ſmooth, as <hi>Maſius in Peculio</hi> and <hi>David de Pomis</hi> in his Dictionary teach. And <hi>Ferrarius</hi> turneth the word pure, ſincere, plaine, which anſwereth to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. 4. In <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. for a good and honeſt, it hath the ſame word, as if it was a poliſhed heart, made even and ſmooth: or if you will, a ſound heart, intire and well conſtituted, and ſet in frame, as amongſt the Arabicks, the root is to heale, or reſtore whole or intire. Upright or ſtrait is oppoſed to crooked and oblique: but to this preſent purpoſe, That is upright which doth anſwer to the rule of the divine Law, concerning the love of God and our Neighbour. An upright man is he who by faith working by love doth ſtudy to conforme himſelfe to the Law in all duties of holineſſe, ſobriety, juſtice, or mercy. An upright man is he, who doth not writhe or bend himſelfe, nor (as we ſay) ſerve the time or humours of men, but God and his conſcience, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forbids him, who ſerves God and his conſcience, to ſerve the time, when it may be done without detriment to the glory of God or to his conſcience. A ſtraight way is ſhorteſt betwixt the points. Now the Word of God directeth the ſhorteſt and next
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55916:98"/> way to Heaven: and the man that walkes in that path, doth walk uprightly. And here it may be noted, that to doe what is right<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 22. Joh. 8 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Scriptures mention an uprightneſſe of heart, and uprightneſſe of life and converſation. Uprightneſſe of heart is an holy confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of heart and ſoule to the good will and pleaſure of God. Thus we reade, <hi>God ſaveth the upright in heart, Pſal.</hi> 7. 10.

O continue thy righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the upright in heart. Pſal. 36. 10. All the upright in heart ſhall glory. Pſal. 64. 10. Doe good, O Lord, unto them that be good: and to them that are upright in their hearts. Pſal. 125. 4. Good and upright is the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 25. 8. His will is the moſt certaine rule of equity and rectitude: and our hearts are then upright, when they ſtand in an holy conformity to the good pleaſure of God. This is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed by the phraſe of preparing the heart to ſeeke God,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 19. 3. 2 Chron. 17. 6.</note> or lifting up the heart in the wayes of God. And herein is implied, 1. An holy diſpoſition of mind, will and affections, bending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the good pleaſure of God, approving, affecting, exerciſing readily whatſoever he requireth. I know alſo, my God, that thou tryeſt the heart, and haſt pleaſure in uprightneſſe. As for me in<note place="margin">2 Chr. 29. 17.</note> the uprightneſſe of mine heart, I have willingly offered all theſe things. 2. A godly fervency of heart, which maketh that in chooſing and embracing good things, it is equally more remiſſe or fiery and ſtrong, as the goodneſſe of the things be greater or leſſe, of greater or leſſe neceſſity and importance. Thus an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart hath reſpect to every Commandement, but his greateſt care is about the weightie matters of the Law, holineſſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and the more excellent the duty, the more circumſpect and forward is he in the performance of it. <hi>The upright love thee,</hi> or they love thee in uprightneſſe. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4. that is, with a ſtrong and vehement love, which is without diſſimulation or guile. Therfore (ſaith <hi>David) I eſteeme all thy precepts concerning all things to be right, and I hate every falſe way. Pſal.</hi> 119. 128. 3. An upright mind in all purpoſes and actions doth aime directly at the right marke, and propoſe the true end by juſt and approved meanes. A right end never hath a crooked rule leading unto it: and a right heart doth neither look awry, nor goe by a crooked rule. Thus it is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55916:99"/> ſaid of <hi>Ezra,</hi> that he had prepared his heart to ſeeke the Law of the Lord, and to doe it, and to teach in Iſrael Statutes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 10.

               </p>
               <p>Uprightneſſe of life, is a converſation, way, or courſe of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the word of God in that calling or vocation, wherein God hath placed us. Thus it is ſaid of <hi>David, That he walked</hi>

The third effect of uprightneſſe is hatred of all ſinne, of our boſome, delightfull, profitable ſins, of ſecret ſins, of the ſins of our inclination, cuſtome, education, whatſoever, but more in our ſelves then in others: and love of good, ſpecially the beſt and chiefeſt good, in others, as in our ſelves. Homebred ſin is moſt hatefull, becauſe moſt hurtfull to the ſoule, pernicious to our State, diſhonourable to God. And it is a good token of a plaine and down-right heart, when a man is willing to ſee, ready to acknowledge, and can with eagerneſſe of affection ſet againſt his owne ſinne, rather then againſt the ſins of other men. For the love of ſin is abandoned, the heart is framed to ſelf-deniall, which it hath not by nature, but by grace: and ſinne will have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to lodge in that heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where it is thus purſued. But true goodneſſe is lovely in all men, becauſe it proceeds from God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth a man after the image of God, and inableth to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his commandment: and whoſe heart is right with God, he cannot but rejoyce to ſee his name glorified by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

Who ſeeks for health, till he know himſelfe to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed? And ſhall ever any man be brought to the underſtanding of his defect in this, untill he hath been made to ſee it by the word? What health is to the body, that truth and uprightnes is to the ſoul: now bodily health ariſeth from the ſeed, is preſerved by ſound and good diet: But the word of truth is the wholſome food, wherby the ſoul is nouriſhed. The word is a word of uprightneſſe or rectitude, and when it is well learned, and throughly digeſted, ſafe lodged, and<note place="margin">Jam. 1. 20.</note> cloſe applied, it doth ſeaſon and regulate the heart and affections, and change them into the nature of it. If we bind our crooked affections cloſe to the word of truth, they will become ſtrait, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto the word, whereunto they are bowed.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third meanes is to poſſeſſe our hearts with this, and to have it ever in our thoughts, that in all things, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, we have to doe with God, and are ever in his ſight and preſence. In our common daily duties to labour thus to performe them with our heart, as in the ſight of God, to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is a ready way to get this grace of truth deeply rooted. It is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55916:103"/> the very maine ground of all hypociſie, that this one thing is not duly thought on. Men forget him that ſeeth in ſecret, whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire, wherewith he pierceth further then the outward face: and hereupon they are not to imagine, that when they have carried the matter ſmoothly and fairly before men, all is well. The world either applauds them, or accuſeth them not, and hereupon they flatter themſelves, as if nothing more were to be looked after. Let us then remember this, if we would be true and ſincere in our hearts; <hi>The waies of man are before the eyes of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 5 21.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lord, and he pondreth all his paths.</hi> This kept the Church and people of God of old in their ſincerity, and preſerved them from dealing falſely concerning his Covenant; they thought with themſelves, If we doe thus and thus, ſhall not God ſearch it out?<note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 17, 21.</note> for he knoweth the ſecrets of the heart. And this conſideration moved <hi>Paul</hi> to faithfulneſſe in his Miniſterie; <hi>We make not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the word, but as of ſincerity, but as of God, speake we in</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt.</hi> See what things goe together, doing a matter in ſincerity, and doing it, as in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Society and fellowſhip with the faithfull is a ſigne of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, and a meanes of continuance and encreaſe therein. For he that ſetteth his heart upon heaven, will be carefull to draw on and encourage his companion in the ſame way. Coales laid together kindle each other, and preſerve heate the longer: So it is with the faithfull linked together in holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is good to call our ſelves to a frequent reckoning touching our carriages, binding our ſelves to an examination of them. He that hath a ſervant, of whoſe fidelity he maketh ſome doubt, and whom he deſires, if it might be, to reclaime, both for the good of the party, and for his owne particular alſo, that he may be uſefull to him, he will not let him run on too long before he call him to an account; he conſiders that to be the next way to make him careleſſe and ſecure. If he expect ever and anon to be reckoned with, it will cauſe him ſo much the more carefully to looke unto his buſineſſe. It is ſo in this caſe. The word of God telleth thee, that thou haſt with thee a falſe, cooſening, deceitfull heart: an heart that will beguile thee to thine utter ruine; it is ever ready to practiſe with Satan the profeſſed enemie of thy ſoule, to worke miſchiefe againſt thee: Wouldſt thou reforme this heart, that it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55916:103"/> might become uſefull and ſerviceable for thee, in the great and important buſineſſe of Salvation, be ſure to call it often to account. It will be good to reckon with it once a day, to ſee what hath paſſed it, to examine what thoughts have been framed in it, what purpoſes, what intents, what acts have been done, as effects and fruits of theſe inward purpoſes: ſurely this tying of thy ſelfe to ſuch an often ſurvey, and looking back upon thy heart, will keepe it in ſo much the more awe; and when it is once accuſtomed to the ſweetneſſe which will be felt, when it can give account of care and of obedience, and to the ſmart and puniſhment which followeth the remembrance of failing in holy duties, it cannot but be kept in ſo much the better tune.</p>
               <p>And to finde out the better the guile of our ſpirit, and croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of affection, Firſt conſider what ignorance, vanitie, folly, infidelity doth ſtill remaine in the mind, what ſtubbornneſſe in the will, benummedneſſe in the conſcience, diſorder in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: how apt we are to undervalue the true treaſure, looſe our ſelves in baſe delights, abuſe things lawfull in exceſſe: how laviſh and raſh in our ſpeeches, dull and droſſe in holy performances, pettiſh and impatient if a little croſſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider how careleſſe we are of the ſpirituall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in thoſe things we performe, as in prayer, hearing the word, receiving the Sacraments, giving almes, &amp;c. To the ſpiritual, performance of theſe and ſuch like duties is required a preparation and heavenly diſpoſition of ſoule befitting ſuch actions, and the Majeſtie of God with whom we have to deale; as in confeſſion of ſinne is required griefe, ſhame, humility: in ſupplication re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, devotion, ſpirituall emptineſſe, whereby the heart is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off the creature, and driven out of our ſelves. But who doth not lightly paſſe over theſe duties? which is no better then the wiping of the out-ſide of the diſh, not looking to that within. Doe we not ruſh upon prayer without premeditation, give our hearts liberty to rove about, forgetting with whom we have to doe? are we not perfunctory in craving Gods bleſſing upon our meate at ordinary meales, and in giving thankes when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Marke that in reſiſtance of ſinne, we are more ſorrie, and deale more againſt this or that branch of Corruption, which appeareth to our diſgrace, then againſt the body of death it ſelfe;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55916:104"/> and againſt that ſinne whereunto we are not ſo much enclined, more then againſt others no leſſe dangerous, whereunto we are diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider the courſe of our affections, and we ſhall ſee how unſound we are towards God and our Brethren. If a thing touch our ſelves, our blood will quickly be in our nailes: If a man know this or that a miſſe by us, it is very grievous, the ſhame of it much upbraids us: but things that offend God, and which we know he ſeeth amiſſe in us, we can let theſe paſſe nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. A ſigne our love to him is not ſo ſound, our feare of him, and deſire of praiſe with him, not ſo unfained. We ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be found often in the ſame fault before men: but we commit and confeſſe the ſame ſinnes daily before God, and are not confounded in our ſelves. If we ſpeake but an haſty or unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed word in the preſence of ſome grave and godly man, that might be to our diſgrace, our thoughts trouble us: but the offence againſt God is lightly paſſed over. We are circumſpect to avoid the breach of penall lawes, not ſo carefull to watch againſt the committing of ſinne againſt God. We confeſſe ſinne before God, and ſeeme to aggravate it: but being queſtioned by men, we turne the faire ſide outward, and make the beſt of it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Let us obſerve how frequently our actions are corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In leaving ſinne many time we leave it not becauſe we hate it as ſinne, but it hath often broaken out to our reproach; our friends perſwade us to breake it off, it will be for our credit and advantage. We confeſſe our owne ſinnes, not deſiring to give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, and gaine a teſtimony of a ſound heart: but becauſe worldly wiſdome doth tell us, It is beſt to tell our owne tale, or it were double folly to make daintie of that all the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: It will not be for our credit to leſſen our fault, when it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne; we ſhall looſe the eſtimation of good men if we ſeek to hide, excuſe, or make light of our offences. Our promiſes of amendment, when we have been overtaken with ſinne to our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, have not proceeded from due conſideration, nor had due execution accordingly. In the profeſſion of religion we have oft aimed at ſiniſter ends, as praiſe of men, gaine, or the like, Thus in taking up good duties, as orders in our family, we often looke not ſo much at the conſcience of Gods Commandement, as at this, The eyes of men are upon us, all the world will cry ſhame,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55916:104"/> if ſuch things be neglected altogether. Our performance of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties is farre more dull, ſuperficiall, and ſleight, then that which is done in the ſight and company of others. The preſence of men doth oft reſtraine from many haſtie ſinfull ſpeeches and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable actions, which we take liberty to ſpeake and doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of the moſt high, and are not aſhamed. Our rebukes are carnall, rather becauſe our minds are croſſed, then that God is dishonoured. Our obedience is partiall, this we doe, another thing no leſſe materiall we paſſe over without regard: and we meane well many times, and are fervent in a good thing, not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſiniſter reſpects, and yet not only, nor reſolutely for Gods Commandement, but more for other conſiderations then that: And therefore in ſuch caſes and tryalls, we are found to be others, if we examine it, then we would be. We beare with faults in him that is ſerviceable to our humour, againſt another not ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in our eye, we are hot and fiery. Sometimes we undertake to deale for ſome that ſpeake to us, but doe it without any heartie well-wiſhing to him, ſometimes not ſticking to ſay to our friend, I muſt ſpeake to you for faſhion, but doe as you pleaſe. We viſit ſick ones, but not ſtirring up the bowels of mercy, we ſpeake a great many phraſes of courſe, our conſcience telling us it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. We make a ſemblance of reverence, but how farre it is from the heart this may teſtifie, that we can (abſent from the parties) uſe their names proverbially, breake jeſts on them, admit ſiniſter ſuſpitions. We can ſpeake faire to mens faces, when warre is in the heart: and when we hate the perſon, take on as if we ſought the diſgrace of his ſinne only. So in fruits of love, we can doe this partie good ſometimes, but it is to keep another under, who elſe would ſprout forth ſo farre, that his ſhade would dimme our lights: as likewiſe I will doe for ſuch an one, they know good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, they will doe their homage, ſuch an one will thanke me for it, I am ſure it will not be given cleane away: He is able to doe me a good turne againe, &amp;c. In works of mercy we are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, free, compaſſionate, forward: we ſeldome conſider the neceſſities of others, ſtand a loofe, if any man will ſteppe before us in the worke, pretend ignorance, and are glad to hang the burden upon other mens ſhoulders, that be leſſe able to beare it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, After we have diſcovered and found out the crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55916:105"/> and unſoundneſſe of our heart and life, we muſt take up our ſelves for halting, bewaile it with ſhame and ſorrow, ſtirre up our ſelves to more uprightneſſe and ſincerity, and fly unto God by hearty prayer to be eſtabliſhed and confirmed. Though there may be ſome reliques of hypocriſie in a good man, yet the nature of halting is, it will goe quite out of the way if it be not healed. <hi>And make ſtraight ſteps unto your feet, leaſt that which is halting be turned</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>out of the way.</hi> Ah, the frowardneſſe of my heart, how crooked have my wayes been in the ſight of the Lord? I have regarded vanity, doted upon tranſitory pleaſures and profits, undervalued the true treaſure. The ſtreames of mine affections have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with full ſaile to that which is little worth; but ebbe to what they ſhould covet above meaſure. My whole ſoule, all that is within me, ſhould have looked continually upon God, and my converſation directed towards him: but my thoughts, deſires, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, words and actions have looked ordinarily, very often, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. How farre am I from that truth which God requires in the inward parts? what a maſſe of wicked fraud and deceit is heaped and piled up within me? what rottenneſſe doth lodge ſtill in my breaſt? what am I but a ſhop of lies and vanities? Eaſier it is a great deale to know the number of my haires, then the running motions of my heart and affections. Oh, the blind corners, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret turnings and windings, the cloſe lurking holes that are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: upon examination I have found a world of falſhood in my ſoul, more then ever I ſuſpected or imagined. My cogitations are vaine, if not wicked and ungodly, mine affections unſound, mine aimes indirect, my courſe of life palpably groſſe in diſſimulation before God, and towards men. If the members of my body were crooked and deformed; my mouth, face, eyes drawne awry or ſquint; if one part did ſwell, another wither and pine away; I ſhould eſteeme it an heavy croſſe. But the diſtemper of the ſoule is much more dangerous, as the ſafety of the ſoule is more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then of the body. If in a journey I chance to ſtrike out of the way, or fetch compaſſe about, when I might have gone a ſhorter cut, how am I grieved at my ignorance, that I knew not, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that I enquired not the right way in time? But in the courſe of Chriſtianity I have turned aſide, and ſtepped out of the right path to my great loſſe and prejudice. Did I ſtand convicted before men for ſome notorious coozener or deceiver, I could not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55916:105"/> but take it grievouſly: but many times I have played faſt and looſe in the preſence of the all-ſeeing God, pretending his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when I have done mine own will; offering him the body, when the ſoule hath been let looſe after vanity. <hi>I have too long wandered and gone aſtray like a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Traveller takes the next way to his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes end: No wiſe man will willingly ſtep one foot out of the way to Heaven. If our limmes be crooked, we omit nothing that Art or Exerciſe can doe to ſet them ſtrait: and ſhall not I take care to rectifie my ſoul, and bring it into right order? Deceit and falſhood is the Image of Satan, who abode not in the truth, moſt unmeet to be borne by him that is by adoption the ſonne of God. The charge of God is, <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy; be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> and hereby may we aſſure our hearts that we are the children of God, if we be true, as he is true. Truth is the Image of God ſtamped upon their hearts whom the Lord hath called to be his peculiar people. What ſoundneſſe is to the body, that is ſincerity to the ſoule: a grace of ſingular excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and excellent uſe, pleaſing to God, and profitable to man. Wiſe men delight in ſound and faithfull friends: the Lord takes pleaſure in them that be true hearted to his glory. A ſound body is fit for labour: a true heart is ready prepared for any ſervice that God requires. The way is not tedious to men, they halt not in it, but through weakneſſe and imperfection: O my ſoule, the way of life would be moſt pleaſant and delightfull, croſſes eaſie to be borne, the comforts of grace moſt ſweet and admirable, were it not that corrupt humours cauſing diſtempers, did ſtill breed in thee. Earthly deſires, vain delights, unruly luſts are great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments to the quicke and eaſie diſpatch of the Chriſtian Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

A Covenant in reſpect of the manner of agreement; a Teſtament in reſpect of the manner of confirming. A Covenant in reſpect of<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 16.</note> God; a Teſtament in reſpect of Chriſt, who being appointed of the Father Lord and Prince, with full poſſeſſion of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, died as Teſtatour, and confirmed by his death the teſtamentary promiſe before made, of obtaining the eternall inheritance by the remiſſion of ſinnes. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> by the light of preaching was greater then the Prophets, that had gone before him: but properly he was not a Miniſter of the new Teſtament, as it differed from the old: wherefore a middle place is rightly aſſigned to him, being the forerunner of Chriſt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 11.</note> the way before him. From the birth of Chriſt, the things foretold in the old Teſtament pertaining to the conſtitution of the new, began to be fulfilled; and that firſt by his comming in the fleſh, afterwards by his adminiſtration, and then by his death: by whoſe death the old Teſtament was aboliſhed, and the new did ſucceed in the roome thereof. The old Teſtament was aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the death of Chriſt in right, but not in act. For before the promulgation of that innovation by the ſound of the Goſpell, they amongſt the Jewes that did beleeve in Chriſt were true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, though they were zealous for the Law: but after the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<note place="margin">Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that properly the<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 10.</note> beginning of the new Covenant is to be fetched from that time, wherein Chriſt hath fulfilled all things, which were ſhadowed of him in the Law, or foretold in the Prophets, that is, after that Chriſt was corporally aſcended into Heaven, and had ſent downe the holy Spirit in the viſible ſhape of fiery tongues upon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 3, 4.</note> at the ſolemne feaſt of Pentecoſt; For the ſumme of the Goſpell or new Teſtament is this, that the Ceremoniall Law is ceaſed, and the uſe of the Law (whereby we were kept in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage untill faith was revealed) aboliſhed: and that Chriſt being already crucified, dead, buried, and received into Heaven, remiſſion
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:55916:107"/> of ſinnes in his bloud is clearly, plainly and openly propounded, offered and given to all them that by true and lively faith doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he is Chriſt the Lord and Saviour, and that the Spirit of Adoption is ſent into their hearts, who by firme affiance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence doe reſt in the Redeemer, that being taught of God they ſtand not in need of the legall pedagogie. Surely, that doctrine concerning faith in Chriſt, cannot ſtrictly be called the Goſpell, which did take place, the Moſaicall worſhip as yet in force, and that by the approbation of Chriſt, thoſe things not being fullfilled as yet, which were preached in the Goſpell. For the Goſpell is a meſſage of good tidings or things paſt, which affect the heart with ſingular joy and chearefulneſſe. And as the old Covenant was not promulgated without great pompe upon Mount Sinai, the people of Iſrael hearing and beholding, and ſwearing unto it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 18. and 20. ſo it was meet that the New Teſtament, ſhould be publiſhed on a ſolemne ſet day, in the aſſembly almoſt of all Nati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns, with great ſplendour and glory, as it was on the feaſt day of Pentecoſt. And before that time the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning faith was of that ſort, that men were rather called to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Kingdome of God, then commanded to reſt in the preſent ſtate of things. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> put over his hearers to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt, <hi>Joh. 1. 26, 27. Luke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 16. Mark 1. 7, 8. Matth.</hi> 3. 11, 12. Chriſt invites men to the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, the Evangelicall Government of the Church, as future at hand, but not yet preſent. <hi>Matth. 4. 17. Mark</hi> 1. 15. Nay, after he was riſen from the dead, although he profeſſe openly and plainly to his Diſciples, that all power was given unto him in Heaven and earth, and he command them to preach the Goſpell to every creature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19. yet he gives them a charge to tarry at Jeruſalem, to waite for the accompliſhment of the promiſe concerning the ſolemne ſending of the holy Ghoſt, and to be endued with power from above, <hi>Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 24. 49. as if they were deſigned before, but then to be inaugurated, and by extraordinary gifts, many hearing and beholding, openly to be approved. The dayes immediately following the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, were the dayes of the Churches wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood, wherein ſhe ſate (for a while) deſtiture and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and barren, having neither power to beare, nor to bring forth children. But within ten dayes after Chriſt, the Lord, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome of the Church, had aſcended from earth to Heaven in
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:55916:108"/> glory, the holy Ghoſt came downe upon the Apoſtles in viſible ſhape, in token that Chriſts Church was now betrothed unto him, and had received ſtrength to conceive and bring forth, and breaſts repleniſhed with plenty of Milk to nouriſh and feed her children. This was as the Solemnization of the Marriage, and then did the barren begin to rejoyce, that ſhe ſhould be the mother of many children. From this time properly the New Teſtament tooke its beginning.</p>
               <p>The nature of this Teſtament ſtands principally in three things. 1. In the kinde of Doctrine, plaine, full, and meerly Evangelicall. 2. In freedome from the curſe of the Law, and freedome from Legall Rites. 3. In the amplitude and enlargement of the new Church, throughout all Nations of the world.</p>
               <p>It may be deſcribed, the free Covenant which God of his rich grace in Jeſus Chriſt incarnate, crucified, dead, buried, raiſed up to life, and aſcended into Heaven hath made and plainly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the world of Jew and Gentile, promiſing to be their God and Father by right of Redemption, and Chriſt to be their Saviour; to pardon their ſinne, heale their nature, adopt them to be his Sonnes, protect them from all evill that may hurt, furniſh them with all needfull good things ſpirituall and temporall, and crown them with everlaſting glory in the world to come, if they repent of their iniquities, beleeve in Chriſt and through or by Chriſt in him, and walk before him in ſincere, conſtant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable obedience: which he doth inwardly ſeaſe by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the holy Spirit, who is the earneſt of their inheritance, in the hearts of the faithfull; and ratifie and confirme by outward ſeales univerſall, plain, eaſie, and perpetuall.</p>
               <p>The Author of this Covenant is God in Jeſus Chriſt: for none can make theſe promiſes but God, none can make them good but his Highneſſe. Therefore the Lord doth evermore challenge this unto himſelf, that he is the maker of the Covenant: And as it is<note place="margin">Jer. 31. 1, 31, 32, 33.</note> called our Covenant in reſpect of the conditions required, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11. So it is called the Lords Covenant, becauſe he hath made, and will eſtabliſh it. <hi>If ye can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of the night,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then may alſo my Covenant be broken</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 33. 20, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>with David my ſervant.</hi> Chriſt alſo as Mediatour is both the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Author of this Covenant, as he is appointed of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55916:108"/> Lord and King, advanced at the right hand of God to give repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes unto Iſrael, and as Teſtatour<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 16.</note> he hath confirmed the Covenant by his death. But of this in the next Chapters.</p>
               <p>God is both the Author of this Covenant, and one partie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate. Fathers, we know, ſeldome frame Indentures, thereby to bind themſelves what they will doe for their children, if they will be obedient, but by right of Fatherhood they challenge of them their beſt ſervice: Lords and great perſonages ſeldome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with their free ſervants what preferment they ſhall expect after ſome terme of ſervice and attendance, but if they look for reward, they muſt ſtand at their courteſie. But our Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to whom we owe our ſelves by right of Creation, who might take advantage againſt us for former diſobedience, is content to undertake and indent with us, and by Indenture to bind himſelf to beſtow great things and incomprehenſible upon us, if we will accept his kindneſſe and bind our ſelves unto him in willing and ſincere obedience.</p>
               <p>If you demand a reaſon of this dealing, none can be given, but the meere grace and rich mercy and love of God. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord God, I doe not this for your ſakes, O houſe of Iſrael, but for mine holy Names ſake. I will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant, &amp;c. And ye ſhall know</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>that I am the Lord, when I ſhall bring you into the Land of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And there ye ſhall remember your wayes, and all your doings, wherein</hi>
                  <note place="margin">42. 43.</note> 
                  <hi>you have been defiled, and ye ſhall lothe your ſelves in your own ſight, for all your evils that you have committed. And ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have wrought with you for my Names ſake, not according to your wicked wayes, nor according to your corrupt doings.</hi> Man can doe nothing of himſelf to procure his ſpirituall good. In ſpirituall things it fareth with him much what as with a child new borne into the world, which being naked can neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide cloathes, nor being provided and laid by him, can put them on: for man deſtitute of all ſpirituall goodneſſe, can neither move to helpe himſelf, untill it be freely beſtowed, nor manage and wield it well, when it is of grace vouchſafed, without direction and aſſiſtance from God. And there is as little worth or dignity in man to move God to promiſe him help, as there is ability in man to procure help. There is nothing in man to move God to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55916:109"/> ſhew mercy, but only miſery, which might be an occaſion, but can be no cauſe, either why mercy is promiſed, or ſalvation gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If man had not fallen from grace and ſtate of Innocency, God had never ſent his Sonne to redeeme him, nor ſhewed mercy rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the pardon and covering of his iniquity: If he had not loſt himſelf, Chriſt had never come to find and reſtore him; if he had not wounded himſelf, he had not been healed and repaired of grace. Man then is a ſubject on whom God beſtowes grace, and in whom he works it; and his m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſery an occaſion that the Lord took of manifeſting his mercy in ſuccouring and lifting him up out of that diſtreſſe: but the free grace and love of God is the ſole cauſe of what the Lord hath promiſed in this new Covenant, and doth give according to promiſe.</p>
               <p>And though the old and new Covenant be of the ſame nature, and from the ſame fountaine, yet the new Covenant is preferred above the old, as farre as Sunne-light before Torch light, in this, that God who makes the Covenant hath more fully manifeſted the riches of his grace and ſuperaboundant love in Jeſus Chriſt, the brightneſſe of his glory and engraven forme of his perſon, to the federates of the new Teſtament. In the old Covenant the Lord had made it knowne, that he was mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger, aboundant in goodneſſe: But in the new Covenant he doth moſt familiarly reveale himſelf to be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, and in him the Father of the faithfull: which moſt ſweet and pleaſant name doth breathe out unſpeakable love and tenderneſſe.</p>
               <p>Again, though the ancient federates had ſome knowledge of Gods Attributes, as an introduction to the Covenant of Grace, yet they never knew that tranſcendency of Gods love, which is brought to light in the new, mentioned in theſe and ſuch like paſſages of Scripture: <hi>Behold, what manner of love the Father hath</hi>

The holy Ghoſt doth promiſe, that being redeemed by the bloud of Chriſt, by the preſence of his grace, he will cleanſe them from all inherent ſinne, and repaire the Image of God in them: leade them into all truth and holineſſe, inable them to cry, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> ſeale them for the Lords, and abide with them by his grace and comfort as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the inheritance, untill the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion.</p>

And we find the Apoſtles to make a manifeſt<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14, 17.</note> difference betwixt the people of God and unbelievers, ſo that all in their dayes were not admitted into Covenant, though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell was preached unto them. For they that be in Covenant are in phraſe of Scripture the people of God, that is, ſuch with whom God hath contracted Covenant, and who in like manner have ſworne unto the words of the Covenant, God ſtipulating, and they accepting the condition. God as an abſolute Soveraigne hath right and authority over all men: but in a certaine and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar reaſon they are called his people, who receive his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and acknowledge him to be their Lord and Saviour. And theſe be of two ſorts; for God doth make his Covenant with ſome externally, calling them by his Word, and ſealing them by his Sacraments, and they by profeſſion of faith and receiving of the Sacraments oblige themſelves to the condition required: and thus all members of the viſible Church be in Covenant.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55916:110"/> With others God doth make his Covenant effectually, writing his Law in their hearts by his holy Spirit, and they freely and from the heart give up themſelves unto the Lord, in all things to be ruled and guided by him. And thus God hath contracted Covenant with the faithfull only. The firſt ſort are the people of<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 28.</note> God outwardly or openly, having all things externall and pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the outward adminiſtration. The ſecond are the people of God inward or in ſecret, whom certainly and diſtinctly the Lord only knoweth. Experience hath confirmed it, that in the dayes of the Goſpell, the Church of Chriſt hath ſometimes been ſhut up within narrower bounds and limits, ſometimes it hath ſpread it ſelfe over the face of the earth more gloriouſly, and ſo much was plentifully foretold in the Scriptures, that ſuch as lived in the times of that great apoſtaſie and falling from the faith, might not be offended at it. What the ſtate of Gods Church ſhall be in theſe latter dayes, time will manifeſt more certainly then we can yet define: but ſome Divines are of opinion that the bounds thereof ſhall extend further, and the glory thereof be greater then ever heretofore.

But then Chriſt died for all mankind in reſpect of impetration and application both: and by his death hath actually reconciled all mankinde unto God, meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted actuall regeneration for them, and purchaſed Salvation, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be poſſeſſors of theſe ſpirituall bleſſings, they doe not fall from them and ſhake them off by impenitency and infidelity. For <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> excepted, mankind cannot be conſidered in the<note place="margin">Armin in Perk. pag. 4.</note> common lapſe, but as infants only. Further they affirme, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have refuſed grace in their parents, grandfathers, anceſtors, by which act they have deſerved to be forſaken of God: which how it can ſtand with their generall poſition, or that laſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, I cannot conceive. Laſtly, they teach, that Chriſt died for the impenitent and unbelievers: for thus they reaſon, If Chriſt died for all whom he came to ſave, and came to ſave unbelievers, as his words are, I came not to judge, but to ſave, then he died for unbelievers. How they accord theſe things, I cannot finde; but if we take things as they lay them downe, it will plainely follow, that Chriſt died for all mankind in reſpect of impetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, and that he died for them in reſpect of impetration and application both; that he hath not actually reconciled them unto God, and that he hath purchaſed actuall reconciliation; that he died not for the impenitent or unbelievers in reſpect of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and that in reſpect of impetration only, he died only for ſuch.

               <p>The ſecond ſort of Divines diſtinguiſh the ſufficiency and effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſts death. In reſpect of the worth and greatneſſe of the price he died for all men: becauſe it was ſufficient for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of every man in the world, if they did repent and believe: and God might without impeachment of juſtice have offered Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to every man in the world upon that condition if it had been his pleaſure.

Others proper to the members of the viſible Church and common to them, as to be called by the word, injoy the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of grace, live under the Covenant, partake of ſome gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that come from Chriſt, which through their fault be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: and in this ſence Chriſt died for all that be under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. But other fruits of Chriſts death according to the will of God and intention of Chriſt as Mediatour, be peculiar to the ſheep of Chriſt, his brethren, them that be given unto him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as faith unfained, regeneration, pardon of ſinne, adoption, &amp;c. and ſo they hold, Chriſt died efficiently for his people on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſence, namely, ſo as to bring them effectually to faith, grace and glory.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to examine what the Scriptures teach in this particular. The Apoſtle writeth expreſſely, that by the grace of<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note> God Chriſt taſted of death for all men or diſtributively for every man. Some referre this to the ſufficiency of Chriſts death: but all men, cannot be referred to man-kinde conſidered in the common maſſe or lapſe: for the words muſt be underſtood of the death of Chriſt as it was ſuffered in time, and not as it was decreed of God, and of men conſidered as at that time. But at what time Chriſt ſuffered, mankind could not be conſidered as in the tranſgreſſion of our firſt Parents. The Jewes were of opinion, that Chriſt the Meſſiah was promiſed a Saviour to them only. How, to impetrate Salvation? No, but to be applied as in Covenant. Now to beate downe their pride, the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt taſted of death for all, ſc. both Jew and Gentile, who ſtood in relation by virtue of the Covenant, as the Jewes did. So that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the application of Chriſts death, which is not abſolutely common to all and every man in the world: and by every man is meant, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man who heareth, receiveth, and is partaker of the fruit and benefit of Chriſts death offered in the word of reconciliation: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man who is under the new Covenant, as it is propounded of God in the Goſpell and accepted of them. But every man under the new Covenant, as he is under the Covenant, is partaker of the fruit &amp; benefit of Chriſts death. That the paſſage is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of them that apply and poſſeſſe the fruit of his death, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by divers reaſons from the verſes precedent and ſubſequent.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:55916:113"/> The world to come, verſe 5. may well be that all, or every man for whom Chriſt taſted death: but that world to come is that happy age, which the Prophets did foretell ſhould begin at the comming of Chriſt, whoſe accompliſhment or fulfilling we expect as yet.<note place="margin">

Heb. 2. 16.</note> They for whom Chriſt died are in the ſame Chapter deſcribed to be one, that is, of the ſame nature and ſpirituall condition with Chriſt, to be his brethren, ſuch as truſt in God, the children of God given unto Jeſus Chriſt, the generation or poſterity of Chriſt, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, whom Chriſt tooke by the hand and lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up from their fall, the ſeed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But theſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to them only that poſſeſſe the fruits and benefits of Chriſt, for whom he died by way of application. If the maintainers of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall redemption conſider their owne grounds, it will be hard to fit this Text to their purpoſe: or rather from them the former expoſition may be confirmed. For either by all men, they muſt underſtand mankind in the common lapſe, as fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and then Chriſt by his death hath reſtored them into the favour of God, they ſtand actually reconciled, they be regenerated, and if they die before by actuall ſinne committed in their owne perſon they fall from that eſtate, are undoubtedly ſaved: or they muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all men conſidered as obſtinate, impenitent, rebellious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. And then Chriſt died for all, and every man as obſtinate, impenitent and unbelievers: which I cannot find that any of them hath or dare affirme: or by all men they muſt underſtand all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who apply and poſſeſſe the benefits of Chriſts death, which is that we affirme. They ſay (how truly I diſpute not) his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all men, that they are bound to obey him, and live unto him, is grounded upon his dying for every one. But if that be granted, is it not neceſſary that his death ſhould be applied to every one in ſome ſort, at leaſt made knowne unto them in the word of life? For men are bound to obey and live unto Chriſt, as they will grant, not becauſe he hath impetrated righteouſneſſe and ſalvabilitie, but becauſe he hath entred into Covenant with them, made knowne unto them the way of life, imparted unto them his bleſſings, and they have accepted of the condition, and received him to be their Saviour.</p>
               <p>And theſe words, By the grace of God, I ſhould thinke, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port more to them, then that velleity or common mercy, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection of doing good, which <hi>Armin.</hi> and <hi>Corvin,</hi> make

As for the particle <hi>All</hi> or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, examples are uſuall in Scripture where it is uſed with fit limitation, though neither all preciſely, nor the moſt part be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and that confeſſed by all ſides. But what need paralell places to prove it may be, when the circumſtances of the text ſhew it muſt be limited, and they that moſt preſſe univerſall redemption are enforced to acknowledge a limitation in this matter.</p>
               <p>It is objected, that the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh generally in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Chapter, <hi>What is man?</hi> But how to frame any<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 6.</note> reaſon from thoſe words to diſprove the former limitation I ſee not. For this word man deſignes the nature of man in generall, but with relation to the perſon of Chriſt, and is ſpoken of the nature of man, as to be united to the perſon of Chriſt, and alleadged by the Apoſtle to prove, that the world to come, is put in ſubjection unto him as man. And if it be extended further then to Chriſt as man, it muſt be reſtrained unto the faithfull, to whom that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth may be applied by communication and fellowſhip with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, it is objected, that Chriſts dominion over all is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his death: but if that be granted, it is not neceſſary his death ſhould be ſimply for all men.

Mat. 11. 27.</note> Chriſts dominion, not only over all men, but over all things, the Angels themſelves not excepted: but it was not requiſite, Chriſt ſhould die for all things, even for the Angels, as they themſelves confeſſe. His power extendeth it ſelfe unto all creatures, to whom he can command obedience at his pleaſure, and unleſſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, inflict puniſhment. For he is made Lord of the world, and all power is given unto him in heaven and earth. Chriſt hath Soveraignty over all things, and doth rule over all men, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to life, the unfaithfull to death, <hi>Corvin. in Molin. cap.</hi> 12. § 26. This dominion of Chriſt ſtands well with reaſon, is conſonant to the Scripture, but was not purchaſed by his death ſimply for them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It will be ſaid, the Apoſtle threatneth puniſhment for not receiving or retaining Chriſt, and exhorteth to care of it, which argueth generall purchaſe, or elſe ſuch exhortations and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings would be without force. Touching the thing it ſelfe, it is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55916:114"/> freely acknowledged that the ſufficiencie of Chriſts death and greatneſſe of the price was ſuch, that God might <hi>ſalva justitia,</hi> not only invite all man-kind to come unto Chriſt, but alſo bring them unto faith and ſalvation by him, if it had ſeemed good unto him in his infinite wiſdome: and the efficiencie of it ſo great, that God doth ſeriouſly invite many that live in the viſible Church to come unto Chriſt and beſtow many ſpirituall gifts and graces up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by their own fault unavaleable, to whom he doth not give grace to repent and believe unfainedly. But exhortations and threatnings argue not that generall purchaſe in queſtion. For the obſtinate and rebellious, they whoſe eyes are cloſed and hearts hardened, leaſt ſeeing they ſhould ſee, or hearing they ſhould heare, and be converted; even they are exhorted to repent, and threatned for their impenitencie: but I have not found, that the purchaſe was made abſolutely for all ſuch as ſuch. For ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, I can beleeve that Chriſt hath purchaſed not ſalvabilitie alone, but faith, regeneration, pardon and ſalvation, becauſe it is written of Chriſt, That he is <hi>aſcended on high, and hath led</hi>

The ſence then is, <hi>In the fulneſſe of time,</hi> God manifeſted ſo great love unto the world of Jew and Gentile, not of the Jew alone, <hi>That he gave his only begotten Sonne,</hi> and in the Miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſeriouſly invited them to beleeve, and entered into Covenant to beſtow life and happineſſe upon condition of their unfained faith on Jeſus Chriſt. As God loved <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom he choſe to be his peculiar people under the old Teſtament: ſo in the times of grace he extended his love to the world of Jew and Gentile. And as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews God manifeſted ſo much love to the body of that Nation, as to enter into Covenant with them, and vouchſafe unto them the meanes of grace, but unto ſome he ſhewed more ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love, ſo as to call them effectually, and make them heires of ſalvation: In like manner in the laſt times or daies of the new Teſtament God manifeſted ſo much love to the world, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Jewiſh Nation, as that in the miniſtery of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell he entreated them to be reconciled, and entered into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of peace with them: but unto ſome he bare and manifeſted more peculiar love, in that he called them effectually, and made them heires of life. Nevertheleſſe, when theſe Texts be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55916:115"/> of the daies of grace, or times of the new Teſtament, we muſt not conceive, that all men now called Gentiles, were in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Church utterly caſt off, and ſhut out of Covenant, or that the gift of Chriſt to Jew and Gentile is ſo reſtrained to the daies of grace, as that he was not given to the faithfull, whether Jew or Gentile, in all ages: but that the tranſcendent love of God in giving his Sonne to die, and in him receiving the world of Jew and Gentile into the new Covenant is peculiar (ſpecially after the diſtinction of Jew and Gentile) to the times of the Goſpel. This might eaſily be confirmed, both for the ſubſtance of matter, and the ſence of theſe paſſages, out of their writings that be the ſtiffeſt maintainers of the point in hand. See <hi>Vorſt. Paraſc. cap. 4. &amp; 7. Corv. in Mol. cap. 31. § 33. Exam. cenſur. cap. 8. Vorſt. de Deo not. ad disput.</hi> 1. Now then let us compare their poſition, and thoſe texts together, and ſee whether they conſent or diſſent one from another.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The love wherewith God ſo loved man fallen, as to give his Sonne to die (I ſpeake according to their opinion) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men; an incompleate will and affection, whereby God loved them as men; or a volition and intention of being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the love mentioned in this text is a love ſpeciall to ſome ages and ſome men, not common to every man in all ages. It was a ſpeciall love, whereby the Lord loved the Jewes as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar treaſure, above all Nations of the earth, in the time of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7 6. &amp; 10. 14. &amp; 26. 6. &amp; 32. 8. 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 23. 1 King. 8. 53. Pſal.</hi> 33. 12. &amp; 100. 3. &amp; 143. 5. And it is a ſpeciall love, not common to all ages, much leſſe to every man in every age, whereby the Lord hath loved the world of the Gentiles, in the daies of the Goſpell, to take them for his people. And this love is true love, though many pervert the grace of God to their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The world for which Chriſt died was man-kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as fallen in <hi>Adam;</hi> for unbeliefe followeth the death of Chriſt, cannot be precedent to it. But here the world compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends unbeleevers and impenitent in reſpect of their preſent ſtate: and not ſuch only as may fall into unbelief and impenitencie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even ſuch impenitent and obſtinate, as the Scripture ſaith, could not believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 39.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The world for which Chriſt died, (as they teach)
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55916:116"/> doth comprehend every particular man, of what eſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever, in what age of the world ſoever. But the world in the text doth not comprehend all men of all ages, nor every man of any age yet paſſed, but the world as it is ſet againſt the Jewiſh Nation only; not comprehending every particular man of the Jewes or Gentiles, but ſo many, and ſo conſidered, as they give reaſon of that oppoſition. Looke in what reſpects God is ſaid to have choſen the Jewes to be his peculiar people in the time of the Law, but now in times of the Goſpell to love the world in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that peculiar favour at that time manifeſted to them alone, in that ſence is the world of Jew and Gentile to be underſtood, and ſo many comprehended under it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They ſay, Chriſt died for the world in reſpect of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration or acquiſition of righteouſneſſe, not of the application of his death. But this world which God ſo loved, was called by the Goſpell, and did enter into Covenant with God, and God with them: The world which Chriſt came to ſave was a world in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and whereunto he preached peace: and ſo the death of Chriſt was applied unto them by the word and Sacraments, and received by them in reſpect of faith temporary and profeſſion. For when God enters into Covenant with a people, and they accept the conditions, and give up their names unto God, they doe in a ſort apply the death of Chriſt unto themſelves; and poſſeſſe ſome fruits and benefits thereof. And therefore, either theſe paſſages muſt be interpreted of Gods giving Chriſt to die for the world in a ſpeciall manner, or from them it may undeniably be concluded, that he died not for all man-kind. For that which in ſpeciall love was given in peculiar manner to the world of Jew and Gentile in the times of the new Teſtament, that is not the effect of common love, given to all and every man in all ages; but God of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall love to the world of Jew and Gentile in the daies of the new Teſtament gave Chriſt to die for them: therefore of common love he did not give him to die for all man-kind of every age and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And ſeeing God loved ſome, and but ſome, according to the true ſence of theſe places, ſo as to give Chriſt to die, that <hi>whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. Yea ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered for the preſent in the ſtate of impenitency, unbelief and obſtinacy, and (it may be) given up unto a reprobate ſence,<note place="margin">Deut. 9. 9. &amp; 32 28.</note> whereas he caſt off many Nations in former ages, much more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55916:116"/> perſons, who never proceeded ſo farre, continued ſo long<note place="margin">Joſh. 24. 2. Pſal. 100 3. Iſa. 43. 8. &amp; 65. 1. Ezek. 16 3.</note> in theſe ſins as this world had done, muſt we not of neceſſity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome free election or choice according to the good pleaſure of God? Certainly, it cannot be concluded hence, that Chriſt did equally lay down his life for all men without exception, to purchaſe for them actuall reconciliation on Gods part. It is here objected, that this world doth comprehend many impenitent<note place="margin">Synod de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enſ. ſent Remonſt. circ. Art. 2 pag. 301.</note> and unbelievers, that ſhall not be ſaved, and if Chriſt died for one that ſhall not be ſaved, it followeth <hi>à pari,</hi> that he died for all. And it is true, as many be externally in Covenant, and have all out ward things common with the faithfull, who be not true members of Jeſus Chriſt: ſo alſo this world oppoſed to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation, called of God, and admitted into Covenant, doth comprehend many, which in deed and truth be not lively mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt. In like manner many, indeed wicked men and ungodly, living in the viſible Church, and under the externall Covenant, are called the choſen of God, the people of God, Saints by calling, and ſo Chriſt died for them, efficiently, and by way of application, as they be within the Covenant made in Chriſt, and doe partake of thoſe fruits and benefits of his death, which of themſelves tend to ſalvation, but are perverted of them to deſtruction through their owne default. But others compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the world, be faithfull indeed, living members of Jeſus Chriſt, ſealed by the Spirit, and for theſe Chriſt died effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently in a peculiar manner, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to bring them to life and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, as already they are called ſavingly and effectually to faith and repentance.</p>
               <p>The argument <hi>à pari</hi> is of no weight, manifeſtly confuted both by Scripture and experience it ſelfe. For to many that periſh is the word of Salvation ſent, they receive it, profeſſe it, rejoyce in it, live under the Ordinances of grace, be partakers of ſundry graces of the Spirit: all which be ſpeciall fruits of Chriſts death, ſpeciall to ſome, not common to all men: and in which reſpects Chriſt is ſaid to die for them. But to affirme the ſame things of every particular man in the world, is to offend againſt common ſence. If Chriſt had died for one wicked man that periſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had been wicked, or for that reaſon, there had been ſome truth in the argument: but ſome fruits of Chriſts death are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to ſome although they be wicked, not becauſe they are wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:55916:117"/> or for that reaſon. Beſides, it is one thing to ſay, Chriſt died for ſome that periſh, as they partake the fruits of his death in themſelves belonging to Salvation, which is granted, another to ſay, Chriſt died for all men, conſidered as fallen according to the will of God, and intention of Chriſt as Mediatour, with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to purchaſe for them actuall reconciliation on Gods part, which is, that they contend for. So that this objection will be of no force, untill it can be proved, that impretation is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, they be in Covenant, who be not, nor never were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; they have the Goſpell, who never heard of the Goſpell; they have received the promiſe of Salvation, who are rejected and caſt off of God, as aliens from the Covenant; Chriſt is amongſt them, who never had poſſible meanes imaginable to come to the knowledge of the truth; and they are enlightned, and have taſted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the life to come, who all their life long have lived in ignorance and infidelity, and not heard that there is a Chriſt.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.</note>

                  <hi>We thus judge</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe againe.</hi> Here the Apoſtle ſaith expreſſely, Chriſt died for all ſimply meant, in reſpect of the impetration of a new Covenant, and ſalvation according to that Covenant: common miſery is concluded from this, that Chriſt died for all men: <hi>ſc.</hi> that all were dead: which is univerſally true of every man. And upon this ground he exhorts men to live unto Chriſt, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that Chriſt died for all men.

                  </note> Chriſt died, and was raiſed up for all men in generall, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the amplitude of divine grace offered in Chriſt: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the event or effect both are done for all the elect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers only. And in this latter ſence that phraſe is uſed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place. And this the circumſtances of the text will plainly enforce. For he ſpeaks of the death of Chriſt, not as it
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:55916:117"/> was purpoſed and decreed of God, but as it was actually ſuffered by Chriſt, when the farre greateſt part of the world, was for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate drowned in Infidelity and Idolatry, wherein they had continued a long time, being rejected and caſt off of God. The end of Chriſts death and reſurrection there named by the Apoſtle, ſheweth it is to be meant of the fruit and application, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but to him which died for them, that is, that by force of that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they have with him their head, being dead unto ſinne, they ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe. But that can agree unto none, who are not partakers of the fruits of Chriſt; none are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by grace to live unto Chriſt, but they that have put on Chriſt by faith. That <hi>All</hi> for whom Chriſt died, is that world, which God in Chriſt hath reconciled unto himſelfe, not imputing their ſins, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. whereby is meant the world of Jew and Gentile, of which we have ſpoken before in the fore-cited places, which muſt have the ſame meaning; and cannot be affirmed of the world univerſally according to that preſent ſtate wherein it ſtood, when Chriſt ſuffered.</p>
               <p>How then doth the Apoſtle conclude common miſery from this, <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead?</hi> It may well be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, of death unto the world and ſinne, and not of death in ſinne, as if he had ſaid, if Chriſt died for all, then all that are his, are dead to ſinne and to the world. The words and ſcope of the Apoſtle do both agree well to this interpretation. It hath been alleadged, that the words ſpeake of a death paſſed, not preſent, as our tranſlation ſheweth, and ſo could not be underſtood of death unto ſin. But <hi>Vorstius</hi> upon that very word noteth, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth<note place="margin">

Some foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly underſtand this of the guilt of death, that the ſenſe ſhould be, becauſe Chriſt is dead for all men, hence it is truly gathered, that all men are guilty of death; which is refuted in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. This is <hi>Vorstius</hi> his cenſure of that interpretation. As for the words, ſeeing they ſpeake of the death of Chriſt applyed in the time paſt, it was requiſite theſe that intreat of the death of ſin in them that be Chriſts, ſhould be put in the time paſt alſo. And ſo the words doe more confirme, then weaken the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:55916:118"/>
               <p>It is further objected, that it will not agree with the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Apoſtle, who by Chriſts death for all, could not prove all to be dead to ſin, nor ſo much as all the Elect, or all at Corinth. And the drift of the place is to prove, not that all men ſimply are dead to ſinne, for that is notoriouſly falſe, and was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught, nor confirmed by any Pen-man of holy Writ; nor that all the Elect, or all at Corinth are dead to ſin; for he ſpeaketh to the Church or faithfull in Corinth, not to the place, or inhabitants univerſally: but that the faithfull, who had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Chriſt, as himſelf and the converted Corinthians had done, and did for the preſent, were dead to ſin, which he ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth from the communion they have with Chriſt in his death and reſurrection, that is, that Chriſt died for them in effect and event, that the vertue and efficacy of his death did ſhew forth it ſelf in them.</p>
               <p>If the other Interpretation be admitted, the conſequence is good thus, Chriſt died for all believers, therefore all men by nature are dead in ſin: for the ſtate of believers before converſion is the ſame with the others: and if they by the merit, power and efficacy of Chriſts death be delivered from the guilt and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin, who ſo is not ſet free by the death of Chriſt from the power of ſin, muſt needs be dead therein. Arguments not much unlike we have, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 22. As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> In the firſt part all ſimply, in the latter all with limitation, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that be in Chriſt muſt be underſtood.<note place="margin">See Gal. 3. 22.</note> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and 11. 32. But of that there is no need to make many words, becauſe the former interpretation is moſt naturall. The 15. verſe they ſay, need not be reſtrained, becauſe all are bound to live unto Chriſt. Whether all men be ſimply bound to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, becauſe he ſimply died for them, though his death had never been ſignified unto them, I will leave to another place: But the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle is of them, for whom Chriſt died, and who believe in him, and in whom the efficacy of Chriſts death doth exerciſe it ſelf. They that are dead with Chriſt ſhould live unto God.</p>
               <p>They object moreover, that reconciliation is predicated of the<note place="margin">verſ. 19.</note> whole world, which is reconciled thus farre through Chriſt, that God will not deale with man as he might have done, to caſt him away utterly without hope, ſo as he hath the Angels that ſinned,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55916:118"/> but he will accept of him upon termes fitting, according to a new<note place="margin">

In which ſenſe a Father is reconciled to his Son, a Maſter to his Servant, when he is content upon repentance, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and amendment to receive him into favour. Upon this Text they would build a two-fold reconciliation, one generall (as ſome expreſſe it) another ſpeciall; one not an actuall taking away of ſins, not actuall remiſſion of ſins, not Juſtification, not actuall redemption of theſe or theſe, but an impetration of remiſſion, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and redemption, whereby God may, his juſtice not hindring, remit ſins to men tranſgreſſours, which doth imply another member, to wit, reconciliation, juſtification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion actuall. <hi>Arm. in Perkin. §. 25. pag.</hi> 76. or a reconcileable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby men might be delivered from the captivity of ſin, or the neceſſity of thraldome and reconciliation, whereby they are delivered from captivity. <hi>Voſſ.

Chriſt ſufficiently and efficiently doth expiate the ſins of all, and reconcile the world to God, <hi>quantum in ipſo eſt,</hi> that is, as much as pertaines to the execution of his office laid upon him by his heavenly Father. What diſtinction they make of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and actuall reconciliation, or reconcileableneſſe and actuall reconciliation, the ſame may be made of redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, juſtification, and adoption, regeneration and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, ſo that we may diſtinguiſh of them alſo, that there is an actuall redemption and redemption, actuall remiſſion of ſins and remiſſion, actuall juſtification and juſtification, actuall ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſanctification. The terme actuall remiſſion or reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation being ſet againſt reconciliation, as the diſtinct member, doth require, that reconciliation potentiall be underſtood, which may be called reconcileableneſſe. And then Chriſt hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Father by his death, that he ſhould remit ſins, but that he hath power to remit them: he hath not obtained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, but a poſſibility of redemption, or the redemption pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed is a potentiall remiſſion of ſinnes: he hath not merited ſanctification, but a right that he may ſanctifie or ſanctifiableneſſe: he hath obtained alſo that God might pardon ſin, as well as that man might be pardoned or reconciled; and notwithſtanding any
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55916:119"/> redemption that Chriſt hath purchaſed, every man might periſh, and be condemned for ever. But if reconciliation potentiall or a poſſibility of remiſſion only be purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, how is this made actuall by application? If it be actuall and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, why is it not applyed and given to every man? will not God give to every man, that which Chriſt hath merited and purchaſed for every man? The merit of reconciliation by Chriſt, and the application thereof muſt be diſtinguiſhed: but for whomſoever eternall redemption is purchaſed, for them he hath obtained grace and glory, and upon them he will actually conferre that grace and mercy, ſanctifying them to be a peculiar people to himſelfe. <hi>Heb. 9. 12. Matth. 1. 21. Joh.</hi> 4. 14. Application is as neceſſary an effect of redemption or reconciliation purchaſed, as burning is of fire; and there can be no redemption, but of neceſſity it muſt bring application, both in reſpect of Gods juſtice, and Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Dan. 9. 24. Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 14. Therefore there is but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and that actuall and effectuall, though it may be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally propoſed in the Goſpell: and that particular actuall recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is none other but that very ſame, which God <hi>meritorie</hi> and <hi>impetratorie</hi> hath propoſed by the death of Chriſt. As for the preſent Text alleadged, reconciliation is not predicated of the whole world, taking the world for every man in the world, nor reconciliation put for reconcileableneſſe. For it is manifeſt the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the world as it was to be conſidered in the times when Chriſt ſuffered, or after, when in reſpect of preſent ſtate the farre greater part were impenitent, if not obdurate ſinners, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens from the common-wealth of Iſrael, without God in the world: and I deſire to ſee that Text of Scripture, where God is ſaid to reconcile unto himſelfe the whole world of impenitent and obdurate ſinners, as ſuch; or where we ſhall find, that all ſuch<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12.

It is alſo as plaine, that he ſpeakes of the ſurrogation of the Gentiles in the place of the Jewes, and is to be underſtood of the world oppoſed to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Nation.

But what is proper to the times of the New Teſtament cannot be attributed to every man in the world, even thoſe that ſate in darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death, before the light did ſhine upon them.

For it is explained by the non-imputation, or remiſſion of ſinnes, (at leaſt as one part or branch of reconciliation) which is a tranſient act, conferred in time, and inferreth a change of ſtate and condition in the partie ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified or reconciled, and of other reconciliation betwixt God and man the Scripture ſpeaketh not. And it is to be obſerved, that the Apoſtle ſaith not, Chriſt hath purchaſed that God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, or actually reconciled on his part, as if before he were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable: but God was in Chriſt reconciling the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, where the world is the ſubject or matter of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is changed in reſpect of ſtate or condition, now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into actuall favour, whereas heretofore it lay under wrath. In another place the Apoſtle puts reconciliation by the death of the Sonne of God, and juſtification by Chriſts bloud for the ſame: where juſtification cannot be taken for poſſibility of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for actuall juſtification by faith in the bloud of Chriſt, wherewith Salvation is joyned, whereby we are acquitted from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne: and ſo the juſtified or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled are oppoſed to ſinners, ungodly and enemies.

In theſe paſſages we cannot find reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion put for reconcileableneſſe, nor predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all the world, nor all the enemies of God, nor in any other Scripture. For though
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55916:120"/> all were enemies before reconciliation, yet all enemies are not reconciled, but they that be converted to the faith. Thus we are taught in the word of truth, to diſtinguiſh the ſtate of the Gentiles living in their infidelity without God, from the ſtate of the Gentiles reconciled. <hi>But now in Chriſt Jeſus, ye who ſometimes were farre off, are made nigh by the bloud of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the croſſe, having ſlaine the enmity thereby.

And when in the precedent verſe he ſaith, that <hi>it pleaſed the Father by him, (ſcil.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>to reconcile all things unto himſelfe, whether they be things in heaven, or things in earth;</hi> he ſpeaks of actuall reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, not reconcileableneſſe, and all things muſt be limited, as that ſignification of the word, and ſcope of the place doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily require. The ſentence is diverſly interpreted, ſome think it not abſurd to extend it ſimply to all things without exception, but eſpecially to reaſonable creatures, Angels and men. Others think it muſt neceſſarily be reſtrained to creatures of a certaine kind, and interpret it of Angels and men reconciled one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were formerly ſeparated by mans diſobedience. Others reſtraine it to the faithfull in heaven and earth, and expound it of<note place="margin">

But to interpret it ſimply of all men penitent, impenitent, believers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, obſtinate, ſeparated from God by their evill works, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the Text, and hath ſcarce a ſecond Author. No man is to be excluded from ſeeking the benefit of reconciliation: but from the benefit it ſelf the Apoſtle excludes them that be not in Covenant, and in the ſtate of grace, to whom only this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bleſſing doth pertaine. And in the ſame manner this and the like words are to be limited in other places. <hi>Eph. 1. 10. Rom.</hi> 11. 32. And this they muſt not deny, if they would be at one with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for they ſay all men are under a new Covenant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

And reſtitution into the ſtate of grace, and actuall reconciliation, if they be not one thing, they be inſeparable. And this doth take away the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they raiſe from the words following, <hi>And hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>

And he is the propitiation for our ſinne: and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> is like to the former, as all men confeſſe, and hath the ſame anſwer. For as Chriſt is our Advocate by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to plead our cauſe, and defend us againſt the accuſation of all our enemies, ſo is he our propitiation: But Chriſt is not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of every man ſimply, but of his people. And as he is the propitiation of the beleeving Jewes, ſo he is of the whole world:<note place="margin">1 Joh 4. 10.</note> but he is the propitiation of the beleeving Jewes, in that God is propitious unto them in Chriſt, and not propitiable or reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only.

Thus <hi>Vorſtius</hi> himſelf, though in his common places upon this Chapter, he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe words, as if Chriſt ſufficiently and efficiently <hi>quantum in ſe</hi> was the propitiation for the ſinnes of all mankind: yet in
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:55916:121"/> his paraphraſe, he giveth this ſence of the Text; Where fore let<note place="margin">

                  <hi>the riches of the world, and their caſting off the reconciliation of the world,</hi> that is, of the Gentiles converted to the faith, which did make a great part of the world, and before converſion were world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and profane men. The rejection of the Jewes was an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by which the Gentiles, hitherto without that gratious communication, was made rich, and being converted to the faith, did returne into favour with God. And the ſame argument they bring out of the former Text to confute the diſtinction of Chriſts death effectually for ſome, ſufficiently for all, becauſe then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſative particle, doth looſe his emphaſis, if the Apoſtles words be thus underſtood, Chriſt died effectually for us, and not only ſo, but ſufficiently for the ſinnes of the whole world, doth confirme the other interpretation; for the adverſative ſhould looſe it weight, if the ſentence be thus reſolved, Chriſt is our propitiation by faith, in whom God is actually reconciled, and not only ſo, but he is reconcileable to the whole world that lieth not in infidelity.</p>
               <p>The maintainers of univerſall redemption thinke it may ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be proved by this reaſon, All men are bound to beleeve in Chriſt: but Chriſt died for all men, that are bound to believe in him; which ſome propound in this forme; Every man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Chriſt died for him: but whatſoever a man is bound to beleeve that is true: therefore he died for every man. But if by beleeving in Chriſt they underſtand nothing but bare aſſenting to this propoſition, that Chriſt died for all men, and for me as a man, for the impetration of righteouſneſſe <hi>quantum in ſe,</hi> or to purchaſe the grace of the Father and pardon of ſinnes, no man is bound to beleeve it, becauſe it is not revealed in Scripture, much leſſe made knowne to every man in the world by meanes ſufficient. Every man called, whether he hearken to God calling or not is bound to beleeve that Chriſt is offered unto him as a Saviour, ſo as if he beleeve he ſhall be ſaved: but that Chriſt died for him in particular for the impetration of righteouſneſſe, and for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55916:121"/> man in the world, that he is not bound to beleeve, becauſe it is not found in Scripture, nor can he beleeve it, according to their grounds that urge this argument, neither can ſuch perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be the ground of juſtifying faith. I ſay every man in the world good or bad cannot beleeve it, as they teach: For either they be conſidered as in the common Maſſe, as all Infants, and then they be actually reſtored into grace; or as impenitent and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, fallen from the Covenant themſelves, (or as <hi>Arminius</hi> addeth, in their parents) and then Chriſt died not for them as ſuch. If they be admitted into Covenant, and continue therein,<note place="margin">Script. Rem. adverſ. coll. Hag. art. 2.</note> Chriſt died for them in reſpect of application: if they be fallen from that ſtate by impenitency, obſtinacy, rebellion, Chriſt died not for them as ſuch: If they be caſt off, and not ſo much as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly called, how can they beleeve that Chriſt died for them, ſpecially, when by tranſgreſſion they have departed from that Covenant, and fallen from that ſtate unto which (they ſay) they were admitted. Neither can this perſwaſion be the ground of faith juſtifying, for many ungodly men are perſwaded that Chriſt died for all mankind, that neither will, nor can, nor ought as ſuch, to beleeve in Chriſt, or reſt upon him for Salvation: and many beleeve it not, that beleeve truly in Chriſt, and know they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and that they ought to beleeve. If by beleeving in Chriſt be meant faith juſtifying, the propoſition may be granted with two limitations. Firſt, that under this terme they be not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who never heard of Chriſt, or had poſſible, at leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meanes to come to the knowledge of Chriſt, or were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Covenant.

A wicked man living within the pale of the Church is bound to beleeve, as to repent and ceaſe from his evill way; for the neglect of one duty doth not exempt a man<note place="margin">Synodal. ubi Supr. arg. 30. Arm. priv. diſp. de fide.</note> from another: but ſo long as he goeth on in an evill courſe, he cannot lay hould on the promiſes of mercy, nor embrace Chriſt as his only Saviour. The hungry, thirſty and burdened, not they which wallow in iniquity are invited to come unto Chriſt, that they might be eaſed and refreſhed. They are called to beleeve in Chriſt for pardon, not that they are already the children of God, and reſtored into favour. A thirſty and weary man as ſuch, can no more beleeve that he is the child of God, then a wounded man as wounded can that he is cured; or the man ſtung with the fiery Serpent, that he was healed, before he looked up to the braſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Thirſt is oppoſed to water, and weatineſſe to refreſhing. A man muſt believe before he can be in the ſtate of grace, and know he doth beleeve, before he can beleeve that he is the child of God, neither of which can be affirmed of the weary as ſimply ſuch. Thus then I grant all men are bound to beleeve in Chriſt: but thence it will not follow, that Chriſt died for all men equally, to purchaſe for them actuall reconciliation on Gods part, and with full and compleate will and purpoſe <hi>quantum in ſe</hi> to ſave them: but only that Chriſt died for them as an all-ſufficient and efficient Saviour, ſo that in the Covenant of grace ſalvation might be and is tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them upon condition of true repentance and faith unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For they to whom the Goſpell is preached, and by whom it is profeſſed, are bound to beleeve what is offered in the Goſpell, as it is offered there in, <hi>viz.</hi> if they hunger and thirſt, deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be wearie of their ſinnes. But it is one thing to deny our workes, and relie upon the free mercy of God in Chriſt, another to beleeve that Chriſt died for our redemption in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Whoſoever is bound to beleeve hath Chriſt as an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient and efficient Saviour, in and through whom Salvation might be obtained, and undoubtedly ſhall be obtained by him, if he renounce his owne works, and flie to the ſole mercy of God in Chriſt, as the object of faith, in order of nature before either the act of faith, or propoſall of the commandement to beleeve: He hath alſo the rule of new life, and is admitted into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55916:122"/> according to the externall adminiſtration, wherein Chriſt is offered as a ſufficient and efficient Mediatour, ſo that pardon of ſin, adoption and eternall happineſſe ſhall redound to all and every one by his death, if they doe believe: and as a Mediatour by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and ſaving efficacy to reconcile them actually unto God that be in Covenant effectually.</p>
               <p>The word of truth is the foundation of faith, in nature before it, true as it is promiſed, not made true by faith: but that faith cannot be given to the promiſe, unleſſe the thing promiſed be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exiſtent, and made good before faith, is ſtrange in Divinity. One thing is true, becauſe it is promiſed: another, becauſe it is fore-told, another, becauſe it is ſimply declared. Thoſe things which are true as related, thoſe things have been whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them or not: and thoſe things which are fore-told as true, thoſe in like manner ſhall come to paſſe, whether we believe, or believe not. But thoſe things which are true as promiſed, it is not neceſſary that they be, unleſſe we believe.

There is this mutuall reſpect betwixt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſtipulation, that the promiſe is as an argument which God uſeth, that he might obtaine of man what he requireth, and the performance of the thing required is a condition without which man cannot obtaine the promiſe of God. But leaving fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute of this matter, faith in Chriſt and the commandment to believe in him hath a ſubject word true in it ſelfe, not made true by faith, whereupon it is builded, as true, firme and certaine, as any ground of faith in Chriſt can be deſired or conceived. There is one act of faith, whereby we believe that ſins are pardonable: this is builded upon this ground, that Chriſt is an all-ſufficient and efficient Saviour, in whoſe name Salvation is freely offered, by faith to be received. There is another act of faith, whereby we reſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation: this is grounded upon theſe and<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.

               </p>
               <p>It is objected, if Chriſt died not for all men, then a man may
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55916:123"/> doubt, whether he ſhould believe or no? But that ſcruple is not removed by the contrary perſwaſion, that Chriſt died for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the common lapſe: for ſo Chriſt died for many men, that neither can nor ought as ſuch to believe: and he that queſtioneth whether he ſhould believe, doth it in reſpect of former tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, abuſe of grace, neglect of the meanes, and conſcience of his owne unworthineſſe, in which caſe it affords ſmall comfort, and leſſe reſolution to informe him that Chriſt died for all men as ſinners, but not as impenitent or unbelievers. But the direct way and courſe to comfort the diſtreſſed and doubting ſoule in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, is to informe him that his ſins are pardonable, becauſe in Chriſt forgiveneſſe is offered unto him; that he is particularly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led being hungry, thirſtie burdened, finding himſelfe deſtitute both of grace and comfort, to come unto Chriſt for them both: and being graciouſly invited, he is without further diſpute or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to caſt his ſoule upon the promiſes of mercy and come unto Chriſt, that he might be refreſhed. But they are in vaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe, if Chriſt died not for them, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe. Is it then in vaine, that the obſtinate and rebellious are commanded and invited to believe, who as ſuch cannot believe? Was it in vaine, that God commanded <hi>Pharoah</hi> to let Iſrael goe? that our Saviour would have gathered Jeruſalem, when the things concerning her peace, were hid from her eyes? Might not men argue by the ſame reaſon, that it was in vaine for God to intreate and perſwade them to believe, when he did fore-know that by ſuch invitation they would not be allured to come unto him? And if they cannot believe; it is not through the unreaſonableneſſe or abſurdity of the thing commanded, which doth excuſe, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of weakneſſe, as if they would believe, but cannot, which is to be pitied; but impotency of wilfulneſſe and prave affection, the more unable to believe, the more wilfull to refuſe, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable. And though I cannot ſay, God hath given to every man to believe if he will: Yet ſure, God is not wanting to any man in that which either in juſtice or promiſe he is bound to give: and did men deny themſelves, nouriſh the motions of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and earneſtly deſire to believe, without queſtion they ſhould find the Lord gracious. If men believe it is of grace, not only that whereby they are inabled to believe, but whereby they are diſcerned from other men: if they believe not, it is of themſelves, of their own
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55916:123"/> pravity; and they be not further from believing, then from deſire to believe.</p>
               <p>It is objected further, that Chriſt as he died to impetrate remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins for me in particular, is the object of juſtifying faith. The mercy of God reaching to the pardon of ſin in and through Jeſus Chriſt is the object of faith juſtifying, as it is proffered unto us in the word of life: but it is one thing to believe that mercy is to be had through the death of Chriſt, and that it is offered unto us in the Goſpell, and we called to imbrace it, another to believe that Chriſt according to the compleate and full will of God, hath laid downe his life for us in particular to purchaſe for us both grace and glory. Proportionable to the perſwaſion a man hath of Gods wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to be mercifull, is his perſwaſion of the ſufficiency of Chriſts ſatisfaction: and proportionable to his perſwaſion that God is mercifull to him in the pardon of his ſin, is his perſwaſion that Chriſt died for him in particular. Juſtifying faith is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an apprehenſion of mercy in Chriſt to be obtained, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth not an apprehenſion of mercy reaching to the pardon of ſin already obtained. It is not without an application of recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency, reliance, or imbracing, which preſuppoſeth the offer o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> mercy, in and through Jeſus Chriſt to be received, but the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particular perſwaſion, that Chriſt died for me in particular, as well as for any other, or hath purchaſed for me grace and glory, is<note place="margin">Corvin. in Mol. cap. 29. Sect. 24.</note> not required in juſtifying faith. Some have affirmed, that faith whereby I believe that Chriſt died for me, is the foundation of faith whereby I believe in Chriſt: but I ſhould deſire better proof than their bare word for it, ſeeing the Scripture makes the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full offer of ſalvation in Chriſt to the burdened, hungry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the ground of this affiance, and that perſwaſion (according to their poſitions) may be in good and bad, them that never ſhall be juſtified, neither will, nor can reſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation. To believe that Chriſt is an all-ſufficient Saviour, and that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered to me in his name, is leſſe then to believe in Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins; and in order of nature goeth before it. But to believe that according to the purpoſe of God Chriſt is my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, who hath purchaſed for me in particular grace and remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins and eternall redemption, and hath actually reconciled me unto God, this is the conſequent of reſting upon Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and cannot be believed according to the Scripture, unleſſe a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55916:124"/> man doe firſt believe in Chriſt: and according as men reſt upon Chriſt ſuperficially or ſoundly with a ſoveraigne and well-rooted affiance, ſo they believe the other. For when we reade in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that Chriſt taſted of death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. died for all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. is the reconciliation for the ſins of the whole world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. ſhed his bloud for many, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. gave his life for the ranſome of many, <hi>Mat. 20. 28.

Otherwiſe, if it be obſerved, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Jews according to the preſent ſtate, when Chriſt was incarnate, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually raiſed from the dead, I thinke the greateſt Patrons of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall redemption will not affirme, that Chriſt died for every man good and bad, believer or Infidell, obſtinate and rebellious, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe for them actuall reconciliation on Gods part, according to that ſtate wherein they ſtood, when Chriſt came into the world, or was raiſed from the dead.</p>
               <p>Once againe, it is objected, that if this propoſition, Chriſt died for all men be not the ground of particular affiance, it can have no ground at all, neither promiſe of mercy abſolute nor conditionall, generall nor ſpeciall. But already it hath been ſhewed, that bare aſſent or belief that Chriſt died for all men cannot be the ground, much leſſe the only ground of juſtifying faith, and it may further be made evident by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That is the foundation of faith, whereupon particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance leaneth or is immediately grounded. But no mans particular
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55916:124"/> affiance on Chriſt for ſalvation, can be grounded on his generall belief, that Chriſt died for all men: becauſe this notwithſtanding it may be, he is not allowed, he cannot reſt upon Chriſt for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Againe, That is the ground of faith, which doth fully and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyingly anſwer to this queſtion, why doe you, and how know you that you are allowed to reſt upon Chriſt for ſalvation? But the bare beliefe of this propoſition, that Chriſt died for all men, to ſave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not a ſatisfying and full anſwer to this Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Againe, This categoricall propoſition, Chriſt died for all men, ſheweth what is done, whether men believe or not, but doth not warrant every man as ſuch to reſt upon Chriſt, nor promiſe upon condition of faith, what cannot be obtained without beliefe in Chriſt. The ground of particular affiance is ſome word or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to man not yet believing, whereby he is aſſured that as ſuch he is allowed to believe, and that believing he ſhall receive the free forgiveneſſe of his offences; which promiſe is in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before faith, tendered to him that beleeveth not, holding forth free remiſſion upon condition of faith, and is made good to him that beleeveth. What ſome ſpeake of a conditionall promiſe made to beleevers, I cannot comprehend: for if the perſon muſt be a beleever, before the promiſe be offered unto him, then faith muſt hang in the aire, and not be built upon the word, neither can faith be the condition required in the promiſe, but ſomewhat elſe; for a conditionall promiſe, the condition being fulfilled, is conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall no longer, but abſolute; the condition being performed, the thing promiſed is applied and poſſeſſed, and not barely promiſed upon condition.</p>
               <p>What hath been anſwered to former paſſages of Scripture, doth open the true meaning of another, much urged in this matter. <hi>God our Saviour will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour between God and men, the man Christ Jeſus: who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> But <hi>All</hi> in this place doth not ſignifie univerſally every man, in every age and condition: but <hi>All</hi> oppoſed to the Jews only, all indefinitely, and that in the times of the new Teſtament, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. For thoſe <hi>All</hi> whom God willeth to be ſaved, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that they come to the knowledge of the truth, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the ſaving
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55916:125"/> truth of God, he vouchſafeth the Goſpell unto them, and word of reconciliation. But the word of reconciliation was not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to every Nation under heaven in every age, much leſſe to every man; Nor to all Nations in any age, ſpecially ſince the diſtinction of Jew and Gentile, before the times of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>It will be replied, that God was ready to have communicated the Goſpell unto them, if they had uſed well what they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but abuſing what he had given, it was juſt to with-hold fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes from them. But this anſwer will in no ſort fit this place, becauſe the Lords willing that all men be ſaved, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 7.</note> communication of the Goſpell unto all men are plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and ſo is Chriſts actuall giving of himſelfe a ranſome for all, both in this and other paſſages of Scripture. Beſides, it is moſt evident thoſe <hi>All,</hi> which in this place are meant, are ſuch as<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19, 20</note> had fearfully abuſed the common grace received, and with-held the truth of God in unrighteouſneſſe, and for which many of them were given up unto a reprobate ſence. Of theſe the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the times of grace, ſaith, <hi>God willeth that they ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> not that he willeth to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe the Goſpell unto them, if they ſhould uſe the common gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces well, (for they had fearefully abuſed them already) but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to vouchſafe the word of reconciliation notwithſtanding ſuch their abuſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe all whom God willeth to be ſaved, are they that have<note place="margin">ver. 5.</note> God to be their God, and Chriſt to be their Mediatour: but all men in every age have not God for their God. <hi>Is he the God of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>the Jewes only? Is he not of the Gentiles alſo? Yes, of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alſo?</hi> But of the world of Jew and Gentile he is the God, in times of the new Teſtament, and not of the old. The place is much like that of the ſame Apoſtle, for God hath concluded them all<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32.</note> in unbeliefe, that he might have mercy upon all, that is, not upon the Jews alone, but all beleevers, both Jewes and Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; but in Chriſt Jeſus they are all one. This was meant of the daies of ſalvation, and the acceptable yeare which was fore-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. and began from the aſcenſion of Chriſt to receive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall execution, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46, 47. when according to promiſe all ſhould be taught of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45. and Chriſt would draw all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55916:125"/> men unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. Thus <hi>Arminius</hi> himſelfe, the place<note place="margin">Arm. in Perk.</note> intreats of the amplitude of grace exhibited in Chriſt under the new Teſtament: and concludes his anſwer thus, that through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ages God hath willed that all men ſeverally ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved, as they are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Covenant of God, but not as they are fallen from it in themſelves or their parents.</p>
               <p>It is objected, That God willeth that all they ſhould be ſaved, for whom we are to pray. But we muſt pray for all men. But the Apoſtles argument is otherwiſe, that we muſt pray for all men, becauſe God willeth that all ſhould be ſaved, that is, Gods will it is, that the Gentiles ſhould be called, and added unto the Church, the Goſpell ſhould be preached amongſt all Nations: therefore now pray ye for all men, ſpecially for Kings, becauſe by the good affection of Kings to Gods Church, the Church of God is like to proſper farre better then by the converſion of meane perſons. But it no way followeth, that God willeth their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe we pray for their ſalvation. The child prayeth for the Fathers health and recovery, when God willeth he ſhall die. If God ſhould leave us to our owne deſires, peradventure we ſhould deſire, not only that all that now live, but that all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lived might have been converted and ſaved: yea, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell might have been kept from ſin, or having ſinned might have been brought to repentance and ſaved. To deſire that every one that now liveth might be ſaved, with ſubmiſſion to the will of God, is no incongruity. But we cannot inferre thereupon, that it is the will of God to ſave every man now living in the world, or to grant them meanes ſufficient to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. Neither will it follow, that we muſt pray for every man in the world, in every age, knowne and unknowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, ſuch as we never heard of by relation, becauſe we muſt pray for <hi>All</hi> men: for then all muſt comprehend even thoſe that ſinne ſins unto death amongſt the reſt, unleſſe we beleeve that there are no ſuch ſinners in the world: and he had need be of a ſtrong faith, and have ſome extraordinary revelation that beleeveth that.</p>
               <p>Then are we to pray for all and every Infidell, obſtinate, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious perſon, even the whole Kingdome of Antichriſt, that they might come to the knowledge of the truth: but he muſt be a man
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55916:126"/> of ſtrong faith that can believe that God will give his Goſpell to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of theſe in particular, that they might come to the ſaving knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of antecedent and conſequent will, hath no place in this matter, becauſe ſuch are to be underſtood as have moſt egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly abuſed the common grace of God received. Moreover, we ſhall never find in Scripture, that the faithfull ever made ſuch prayers: but as God hath ſignified his will and pleaſure concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the calling and gathering of his people, Jews or Gentiles, ſo they have prayed, as we may pray for the fulneſſe of the Gentiles, and calling of the Jews, wherein we doe not exclude any, though<note place="margin">Act. 5. 31. a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some pleade further, The meanes to this end, that men may have part in Chriſt, are unlimited, the word written, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. and preached, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26, 27. yea, a command to preach to every creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. which <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore warned every man, and taught every man, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. and to beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. But if all this be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nothing will follow which is not freely granted. For as on the one ſide no man will affirm that Chriſt died to this end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to procure forgiveneſſe of ſinne and Salvation to all and every one, whether they beleeve or no; ſo on the other ſide, none will deny, but that he died to this end, that ſalvation and remiſſion of ſinnes ſhould redound to all and every one, in caſe they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and repent. For this depends upon the ſufficiencie of that price, which Chriſt paid to God his Father for the redemption of the world. No man denieth, but God made a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> fallen and his poſterity, as now with the faithfull and their ſeed: that all mankind had continued in this Covenant, if they had not diſcovenanted themſelves and their poſterity; that no man is deprived of the benefits of Chriſts death, but through his own ſinne and corruption: that God is not the cauſe efficient or deficient of any mans infidelity, but man himſelf: That men are ſeriouſly invited to repent in the Miniſtery of the Word, and that the promiſe of Salvation is faithfull and true, ſo that he that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:55916:126"/> beleeveth ſhall never periſh. Theſe things be not queſtioned, nor whether ſome effects or benefits of Chriſts death be common to all men, but whether he died equally for all men, to purchaſe actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reconciliation for them on Gods part, and ſet all Infants in the actuall ſtate of ſalvation, but to procure faith and beliefe for no man, ſo that he had obtained the full, immediate end of his death, though no man had ever beleeved on him, or been ſaved by him. But that which is aſſumed in this argument is apparently falſe, as it is applyed. The Covenant of grace is revealed to ſome, no man being ſhut forth by name, but if he repent and beleeve he ſhall be ſaved: but many thouſands never heard of, never had probable meanes to come to the knowledge of the Covenant. The commandement to preach the Goſpell to every creature, was given to the Apoſtles in the dayes of grace, upon the publication of which Covenant, they which formerly ſerved dumbe idols, were bound to repent and beleeve: but that commandement was peculiar to the Apoſtles, not given till after the reſurrection of Chriſt, after ſuch commandement the Apoſtles were injoyned to tarry for a time in Jeruſalem, nor could they poſſibly diſperſe themſelves in a moment into every part of the world, nor the world take notice of any ſuch commandement given unto them, or of the doctrine revealed by them. Before that time the Lord ſuffered the Gentiles for a long time to walk in the vanity of their minds, without the light of his truth: and ſince that time divers nations have been caſt off, left to themſelves, as aliens from the Covenant, and deprived of all meanes to come to the knowledge of God in Chriſt. And if there were any force in this reaſon, The meanes of grace be unlimited, and command given to preach to every creature, therefore Chriſt died for all men: This muſt be of greater weight, The meanes of grace be not vouchſafed unto all and every man: therefore Chriſt died not for all and every man. For if meanes neceſſary to Salvation be not propounded, if they be not, nor ever were called to the faith by the ordinary and only effectuall meanes ordained of God to bring men thereunto, we ſpeake of our ſelves, and not according to Scripture, if we affirme, God gave Chriſt to die for their redemption.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many effects of Chriſts death reckoned up in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, this is the moſt generall, and all the reſt depend upon it: and if the meanes be not vouchſafed to all, none of the reſt can be
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55916:127"/> common to every one. It is a received principle amongſt them, that as God loved the world, and Chriſt gave himſelfe a ranſome for all men, or is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world ſo God willed that the Goſpell concerning Chriſt ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to all men in the world. <hi>Corvin. in Mol. cap. 31. ſect.</hi> 33. If then the Goſpell be not publiſhed, or God willed not that the Goſpell ſhould be publiſhed to all and every man in the world, Chriſt died not for all and every man. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> having received the Covenant, were bound to teach their children, and ſo ſucceſſively in all ages: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. which had it been obſerved, none had failed to have the ſame publiſhed unto him. If this be applied to the preſent purpoſe, they muſt teach only, that Chriſt died for all and every man, if they that be in Covenant, ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve the charge and commandement of God. And by the ſame reaſon they may conclude, that God gave his Sonne to die, and that with plenary purpoſe, that no man ſhould ever ſinne by ignorance, infirmity, impenitency, unbeliefe, or any particular tranſgreſſion: that God purpoſed to give to every man the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and effectuall meanes of grace, and that every man ſhould actually apply the death of Chriſt. For if every man ſucceſſively had obeyed the commandement given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and fulfilled that charge, the doctrine of ſalvation had been publiſhed to every man, every man had been borne and lived in Covenant, every man had actually applyed the death of Chriſt unto himſelfe, every man had enjoyed all the Ordinances of God: yea, there had been no impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent perſon, I might adde, properly no ſinner but <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Then they could not ſay, Chriſt came to ſave the world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which infidels muſt be comprehended, or that he prayed for his perſecutours and unbeleevers, nor that he came to ſave his people from their ſinnes: for if this charge had been obeyed, there had been no Infidell, nor perſecutour, nor ſinner amongſt his people, but only our firſt Parents. And by the ſame evaſion, they may hold that Chriſt died for all and every man, when he died for no man living, or that ever lived, but <hi>Adam</hi> only. But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove, that ſince many Nations have neglected their charge, and being fallen from God have received from him a Bill of divorce, a commandement hath been given notwithſtanding unto his ſervants in all ages, to publiſh the doctrine of ſalvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every creature amongſt all Nations.</p>

                  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> were in Covenant, is there the ſame reaſon of them and their poſterity continuing in the faith, that there is of them that be ſtrangers to the Covenant, ſhut up in darkneſſe, and never heard the ſound of the Goſpell for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations together?</p>
               <p>It ſeemeth ſufficient to Princes (ſay they) to publiſh their Lawes in ſome places, at ſome times, though they concerne all, are for their good, and take hold of them, if they be not obſerved, leaving it to Parents to teach their children, and every one to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for his own good.</p>
               <p>In this compariſon there be divers things unlike, divers that cannot befitted to the purpoſe, unleſſe it be in a ſenſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For they ſay, Lawes once ſufficiently publiſhed bind and ſtand in force, though unknowne, or ſcarcely poſſible to be known by ſome particular men now living in ſome remote parts of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: And the plaine direct reddition is, That God having made a Covenant of grace with <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, all and every man is bound to beleeve in Chriſt, and walke in obedience, though he be ignorant of his duty, never received ability to do it, never had meanes poſſible to come to the knowledge of Chriſt: yea, though he be caſt off, and left to the hardneſſe of his heart. God hath commanded Parents to teach their children. Who doubts of that? But the queſtion is, whether God hath vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed ſufficient means of grace to every man, which is not hereby proved, becauſe God, when he gave his Covenant, injoyned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to teach their children. We grant the Lord is wanting in nothing, which either he promiſed, or in his eternall wiſdome and juſtice ſaw meet to be done, and that ſuch as be deprived of the means of grace be juſtly deprived. But we ſay, as experience confirmeth, that ſufficient meanes of grace hath not been afforded to every man living ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>

               <p>In the compariſon there be many things unlike.

But we ſpeake of ſuch as never were ſo much as in the outward ſociety of the Church, nor adjoyning to them; that never heard of the Covenant of grace, they, nor many of their Anceſtours, nor of a people or ſociety profeſſing the true Religion.

               <p>There is not a prohibition to preach or write to any, (ſay they) unleſſe it was to puniſh ſome ſpeciall ſinne, as when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Cast not pearles before ſwine;</hi> or ſome others were to be ſerved firſt, as Chriſt ſaid to the woman of Canaan, <hi>I am not ſent, but to the lost ſheepe of the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> and <hi>Paul, Act. 13. It was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that the Gospell ſhould be first preached unto you:</hi> And it was thus when the Spirit forbade <hi>Paul</hi> to goe into one place, and commanded him to goe into another. We might aske unto which of the two caſes they will referre that of our Saviour, <hi>Into the way of the Samaritanes enter ye not. Matth.</hi> 10. 5. and, <hi>Tarry ye at Jeruſalem, untill ye be endued with power from on High. Luke</hi> 24. 49. during which time, and before the Apoſtles could diſperſe themſelves, many millions might depart this life, who never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed meanes ſufficient to bring them to the knowledge of God in Chriſt. And if God have charged his ſervants, not to caſt pearles before ſwine, and prohibited them for a time to preach the Word of the Kingdome to ſome people, and in ſome places, becauſe it is his pleaſure to ſerve others firſt, why ſhould we not likewiſe think, that God in juſtice hath deprived many nations and people of all poſſible meanes, whereby they ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth? Let us ſee how well this fitteth the matter in hand, The meanes of grace be unlimited, but in two caſes there was a prohibition to write, and what is this, but in plain termes to confeſſe, that the meanes of grace in all ages and times, in reſpect of all places and perſons have not been unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Beſides, when no man muſt take this office of preaching upon him, but he that is called thereunto of God, and no man can ſhew that he hath beene called to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell to every creature, why may not this be called a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition?</p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:55916:128"/>
               <p>The laſt refuge is, That any man might have had the Word, uſing that little well that God gave. How ſhould he have had it? By ordinary meanes, or extraordinary revelation. Some are bold to affirme, he ſhould have had it after an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Others ſpeake of I know not what poſſibility by traffique, and the like: both ſorts utter ſtrange things, and it is reaſon we ſhould require better proofes then bare affirmations. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> is a proverbiall ſpeech, whereby our Saviour ſignifieth, that they who be enlightened by the Goſpell, and uſe well the ſupernaturall gifts they have received, ſhall be enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an happy encreaſe. And that the contemners of the Goſpell and grace beſtowed upon them, ſhall have that taken from them which they ſeemed to have. But that men unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate can of themſelves uſe their naturall gifts in an acceptable manner, or that God will beſtow ſupernaturall, upon them that uſe their naturall gifts <hi>minus male,</hi> as <hi>Arminius</hi> ſpeakes, is neither found in the Text, nor confirmed from any circumſtance of it. Twice we find the paſſage uſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 12. and 25. 29. In the firſt it is manifeſt, our Saviour ſpeakes of them that enjoyed the Goſpell: In the ſecond, of thoſe that uſed their Talent, whereby gifts not naturall, but ſupernaturall are meant: becauſe the Lord doth freely beſtow eternall life immediately upon them that uſe their Talent well, which they will not ſay, he doth upon them who uſe their naturall gifts <hi>minus male.</hi> In both places our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhewes, how God dealeth with his, giving them a taſte of his goodneſſe, wherby they thirſt after the augmentation of his grace the more earneſtly, when he doth not affect the hearts of all men in that manner. And if naturall gifts (which they call common grace) be underſtood, then for the abuſe of this light or grace, God doth not only with-hold from men the ſupernaturall meanes of grace, but takes from them their naturall gifts which they had: For ſo the Text runneth, <hi>And from him that hath not, even that which he had,</hi> or ſeemed to have, <hi>ſhall be taken away.</hi> And then I would demand, whether Chriſt died for them that ſo abuſed their naturall gifts as ſuch, or no? If he did, then he died for many, to whom he vouchſafeth not meanes ſufficient to bring them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or faith in him. If he died not for them, then he died not for the farre greateſt part of the world, in all ages, in reſpect of the preſent ſtate wherein they ſtand as men. And here is to be
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55916:129"/> conſidered, that in Scripture you ſhall not find, that God gave Chriſt to die for any nation, people, or world to whom he ſent not the word of reconciliation; nor is any people or nation caſt off, and rejected for their impiety, left without the means of grace, given over to the vanity of their mindes, without God in the world, ever ſaid to be redeemed by the bloud of Chriſt, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God.</p>
               <p>In many places we reade that Chriſt died for them that ſhall, or may periſh, for reprobates and caſt-awaies, 2 Pet. 2. 1. <hi>There ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who privily ſhall bring in damnable hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> Rom. 14. 15. <hi>Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died, 1 Cor. 8. 11. And through thy knowledge ſhall the weake brother periſh for whom Christ died,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Sonne of God, and hath counted the bloud of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> From which paſſages they argue thus, He that died for the elect and reprobate, for them that periſh and periſh not, he died for all men. But Chriſt died for the elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, for them that periſh and periſh not. The Propoſition they take for granted, but it is apparently captious. For he that died for all the elect, and all the reprobate, for all that ſhall be ſaved, and all that periſh, died for all men: but to die for the elect and ſome reprobate, is not to die for all men, but for ſome only. And if they meane it in the firſt ſence, the paſſages of Scripture will not prove what they affirme; if in the ſecond, it fals ſhort of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. But ſuppoſe they argue thus, ſome denied the Lord that bought them, and thereby brought upon themſelves ſwift deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: therefore Chriſt did not buy the elect only, to ſave them: If they diſpute thus, they conclude not the queſtion in hand, they put more in the concluſion then is in the antecedent, and if they cannot ſhew, that there is the ſame reaſon of all reprobates, they muſt confeſſe it makes much againſt them: for the thing to be proved is, that Chriſt died equally for all and every man; and it is one thing to die for the reprobate in ſome ſenſe, and to die for them with an intention and purpoſe to ſave them: and if Chriſt died for ſome and but ſome that periſh in a manner not common
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55916:129"/> to all and every man, it is manifeſt, he died not equally for all men.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the Texts themſelves, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1. Some denied the Lord that bought them.</hi> How? in reſpect of the impetration of righteouſneſſe, or in reſpect of the application of it? Let the Text ſpeake for it ſelfe. Theſe falſe teachers lived in the Church, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Ordinances of God, profeſſed the faith, had known the way of truth, and eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. they had turned from the holy Commandement delivered unto them, and it had happened unto them according to the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>The dog is turned unto his own vomit againe, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> Therefore the death of Chriſt was applyed unto them, and they were partakers of the fruits and benefits thereof by ſome kind of faith. They that moſt urge this place, doe thus interpret it. Thus the Authors of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodal. def. Sent. Remonſt. circ. Art. 2. pag.</hi> 358. It is moſt evidently and invincibly manifeſt, that thoſe falſe teachers, of whom <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes, were truly bought of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of whom they had eſcaped the pollutions of the world: or if thou hadſt rather, that God the Father by the bloud of his only begotten Sonne had truly bought them, and by his Spirit truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated them. <hi>Vorstius</hi> in like manner upon this place: firſt, he<note place="margin">

                  </note> ſaith it is indifferent whether thou referre this word <hi>bought</hi> to Chriſt, or to God the Father. For both God the Father is ſaid every where to have redeemed us, and Chriſt to have bought or redeemed us to God: and then he ſends us to theſe places. <hi>Act. 20. 28. 1 Cor. 6. 20. Eph. 5. 25. Rev.</hi> 1. 5. More plainly <hi>in loc. com.</hi> following, It is demanded, ſaith he, how the Lord may be ſaid to have bought them, who deny him. For this ſeemes contrary to thoſe places of Scripture, in which it is affirmed, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alone, of whom the Catholike Church of Chriſt conſiſteth, be redeemed by Chriſt, <hi>Act. 20. 28. Eph.</hi> 5. 23. and that the faithfull do alwayes remain in the Church. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. Some anſwer (ſaith he) that thoſe who fall away, were never truly redeemed, nor did ever truly beleeve. Therefore they thinke theſe places and ſuch like are to be taken not according to the truth of the thing; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the apearance or opinion: to wit becauſe theſe Apoſtates profeſſe the faith for a time, and ſo feeme both to themſelves, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:55916:130"/> to others judging in charity, to be true beleevers, when in deed they are nothing leſſe. But it ſeemes more ſimple, if we ſay, that ſome who after fall away, for a time doe truly beleeve: which Chriſt doth therefore call Temporaries, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 21. And then concludes, to take away the ſhew of repugnancy, which ſeemes to be betwixt this and the former places. We muſt hold, that Chriſt in act and very deed is the redeemer of the faithfull, as long as they be ſuch: although in power, yea and in will he be the Saviour of the whole world. To let paſſe other things which pertaine not to this queſtion, it is plaine the Apoſtle ſpeakes of them for whom Chriſt died in act, event or application, in which ſence they confeſſe he died not for all men, but the faithfull only as ſuch. And as theſe falſe teachers were called into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, accepted the condition, beleeved in Chriſt, for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in him, and brought forth ſome fruite, ſo we confeſſe they were bought by the blood of Chriſt, becauſe all theſe were fruits of Chriſts death, whereof they were made partakers. As in the Parable, the Lord is ſaid to remit to his ſervant a thouſand Talents, when he deſired him, ſc. inchoately or upon condition, which<note place="margin">Math. 18. 25.</note> was not confirmed, becauſe he did not forgive his fellow ſervant: ſo the falſe Prophets are bought by the blood of Chriſt, ſc. in a ſort, as they beleeved in Chriſt, but not ſincerely and unfainedly. We<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 5, 6, 7.</note> reade of ſome Apoſtates, that they had been enlightened, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the heavenly gift, and been partakers of the holy Spirit, who afterwards did revolt from the faith. To theſe men, their ſinnes were remitted in a ſort in this world, and in a ſort they were bought by the blood of Chriſt, but inchoately only, and as they taſted the word of life.

The purchaſe of redemption goeth before faith, is not made by faith, but applied only: but it is moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if men beleeve unfainedly, they are redeemed effectually, if they beleeve not, they are not redeemed: for them that be caſt off as aliens, we doe not reade that redemption was purchaſed. This interpretation will not ſeeme new, nor ſtrained to them that ſhall weigh the circumſtances of the Text, not to them that urge it, when they ſhall conſider it is their owne. It agreeth well with the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which is to ſhew the fearefull condition of ſuch falſe teachers, becauſe they in life denied the Lord that had called them into Covenant, which they had accepted, whom they had embraced by faith, by whom they were delivered from the pollutions of the world, in whom if they had beleeved unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, without queſtion, they ſhould have been ſaved: and whom wilfully, not of frailty, they had denied. And is not this a good argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to prove, that by their wilfull departure they had brought upon themſelves ſwift damnation. If they were never the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer heaven by ought Chriſt had done, the fault was their owne: for life was truly promiſed unto them, whereof they deprived themſelves, not becauſe they could not doe otherwiſe, but becauſe they would not receive it, or having received it in part, they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily fell off. What though God never purpoſed to make them actuall partakers of the ſaving benefits of Chriſts death? By his commandement he bound them to beleeve, by promiſe he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them of Salvation if they did beleeve, he beſtowed upon them many ſpirituall gifts the fruits of Chriſts death; and if they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, God was no cauſe efficient or deficient of their revolt: And doth not all this conclude their ſinne to be out of meaſure ſinfull in denying the Lord that bought them.</p>
               <p>The other places <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. receive the ſame anſwer; for they ſpeake of weake bretheren for whom Chriſt died, who were beleevers, or as beleevers, for whom Chriſt died in reſpect of application. And then this argument doth not hang handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, Chriſt died for beleevers in reſpect of application, therefore he died for all men to impetrate righteouſneſſe. If they reaſon thus, he died for ſome in reſpect of application that may
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55916:131"/> periſh; therefore he died for all men in reſpect of impetration, it hangs but looſely: for they themſelves will ſay, Chriſt died for the faithfull only in reſpect of application, and not for all men, whatſoever we are to thinke of the condition of the faithfull, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall ſtand, or may periſh.

The Apoſtles exhortation then is forcible, that they ſhould not offend their weake brother, for this was as much as lies in them to deſtroy him for whom Chriſt died.<note place="margin">Perditio eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Laſtly, It is objected, that the Covenant in Chriſt is generall, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. &amp; 6. 30. without reſpect of others.</p>
               <p>As the Covenant is generall, ſo is the fruit and application of Chriſts death, in and through whom the Covenant is made, that is, proffered of God, and accepted of man. As all and every man is called into Covenant, liveth under the Ordinances of grace, is partaker of the fruits of the Spirit, and applieth the death of Chriſt, ſo Chriſt died and roſe againe for him. But this manner of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55916:131"/> Chriſts death pertaineth to the event, act or application, which they confeſſe is not common to all men, and is manifeſt in this, that God entred not into Covenant with every Nation at all times, neither under the Law, nor in times of the Goſpell, <hi>ſcil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act and</note> with the Nations he paſſed by, and which as the Scripture ſaith were without God. God expreſſely declared himſelfe in the time wherein the diſtinction of Jew and Gentile tooke place, that he would accept of ſtrangers, as well as any, if they ſhould love and feare his name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 7. But the Covenant at that time was not made with all Nations, as it was with the Jews, not made known unto all the Gentiles, they did not enjoy means ſufficient to come to the knowledge of the truth; That the promiſes of mercy did at all times belong to them that fulfilled the condition, is needleſſe to be proved: but that the Covenant was made with every man, or that meanes ſufficient or grace to receive the promiſes was granted to every man, at all times, in all ages if they would, is that which no Scripture teſtifieth. And that paſſage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, which promiſeth the acceptance of the ſtranger, if he repent and turne unto the Lord, is manifeſtly ſpoken of the times of the new Teſtament, when the partition wall was broken downe, as the verſes following doe convince. In the daies of grace the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was more generall, then in former times it had been: but God hath not erected his Tabernacle, nor walked amongſt all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in every age of theſe laſt times, as experience teacheth. How then is the Covenant generall, reſpecting every man? Peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they mean no more but this, that every man that will be ſaved, muſt be ſaved by it, and whoſoever doth believe, be he bond or free, Jew or Gentile, male or female, rich or poore, he ſhall be ſaved, though the Covenant was never made with moſt Nations of the world, nor accepted by them, nor they had means to come to the knowledge of it, much leſſe grace to performe the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and then to grant the Covenant is generall will availe them nothing. There is no force in this argument, the Covenant of grace is made with ſome, none being exluded, if they repent and believe, therefore Chriſt died for every man, rather we may ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 16. Col. 1. 23. Act. 17. 30. Tit. 2. 14. Luk. 24. 47.</note> argue, Chriſt died not for every man, becauſe God is not the God of all by Covenant. But the invitation is generall, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in the daies of grace and to them that heare it, and the promiſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall to every believer: we adde, the invitation is ſerious, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:55916:132"/> what God is well pleaſed with, and doth approve in us, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that which he perſwadeth with arguments in themſelves forcible to move and incite, and what he will performe, if we make good the condition. We adde, that the party invited is paſſively capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the invitation, that no man of what ſtate or condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is hindred or kept backe from comming to Chriſt by any cauſe efficient or deficient out of man himſelfe, which doth either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine or neceſſitate his not comming: and he that refuſeth to come, refuſeth not through inability, as unable, though unwilling and deſirous to imbrace it, but willingly preferring ſome baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour good before it. But this argueth only the ſufficiency of Chriſts death, that all men ſhould be ſaved, if they did believe, and the efficiency thereof, that the members of the viſible Church ſhould be invited ſeriouſly, and thoſe that be effectually called ſhould inherit the promiſe.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, to what purpoſe are they called and invited, if they be as unable to come, as a dead man is to ariſe and walke. True it is, every man is of himſelfe unable by nature to come unto Chriſt, and God doth enable whom he pleaſe: but this inability is not from any impoſſibility that is without man himſelfe, either in reſpect of the thing commanded, or any externall cauſe, or bruite neceſſity and diſpoſition, but from his voluntary perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which is moſt blame-worthy. The compariſon may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if rightly interpreted, otherwiſe it is captious: for ſinne is the death of the ſoule not phyſicall, but morall: Man by ſin loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the faculty of underſtanding, and willing, but of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and willing aright, as in duty he is bound, the object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propounded and revealed with fit and convenient light. It is not therefore all one to invite a ſinner to forſake the errour of his way, and call upon a dead man to ariſe out of the grave. The Lord who doth whatſoever he will in heaven above, and in earth beneath, in his deepe and unſearchable counſell never abſolutely intended to make every man actually and effectually partakers of the benefit promiſed, for if he had ſo purpoſed it, it ſhould have taken effect: nevertheleſſe, the invitation is ſerious, ſhewing what we ought to doe, and God doth approve and deſire on our parts: and the purpoſe of God to give faith to whom he pleaſe, and not to all men, is no cauſe of any mans unbeliefe, either efficient or deficient, For that man believeth, this he oweth unto God, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55916:132"/> that not ſimply alone, but comparatively in reſpect of others, who believe not: but that man refuſeth the promiſes of mercy, this is of himſelfe, not of ſimple or naturall infirmity, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pity, but of his owne perverſeneſſe, and love to ſome infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour good, different from the good propoſed, or contrary to it, and averſeneſſe from the circumſtances and conditions of the object propoſed.</p>
               <p>They aske, what ſigne doth God ſhew of deſire or approvall that men ſhould believe, when he gives them not power ſo to doe. This that he commandeth, intreateth, perſwadeth them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe, waiteth with long-ſuffering and patience for their amendment, promiſeth mercy if they will returne, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them of their wilfulneſſe, and though he change not their hearts by the effectuall worke of his Spirit, is wanting to them in nothing, which in juſtice or promiſe he is bound to give, ſpecially when their impenitency is not from lack of grace, but from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe. If this ſatisfie them not, let them anſwer themſelves, how God doth will the repentance of them that be caſt off, and left to the hardneſſe of their hearts? How he doth will, deſire and approve the converſion of ſuch as he hath blinded and hardened for their ſins, even when they are ſo blinded and hardened; as of<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 7. 1 Joh. 3. 12.

               <p>How is it imaginable, ſay they, that impoſſible ſhould be the object of Gods deſire or approvall? The anſwer is given already, impoſſible in it ſelfe, or in reſpect of the unreaſonableneſſe of the thing commanded, is not the object of Gods deſire, approvall or commandment: but an impoſſible thing to us in reſpect of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> perverſeneſſe, may be and is the object of Gods commandment, and ſo of his approvall and deſire, as he doth will and deſire what he doth command. Doth not God exact of the Gentiles given up to the vanity of their minds, that they ſhould ſeeke him in the way, wherein he will be found, if they would be ſaved, when they have not meanes ſufficient to bring them to the knowledge of the truth, nor grace to believe? Doth not the Lord command, approve, and deſire the converſion of many obſtinate, impenitent perſons living in the Church, who have and doe abuſe the meanes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55916:133"/> of grace, whom for their former and preſent contempt he doth<note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 9.</note> blind and harden, whoſe condemnation is aggravated by this, that they have, and doe live under great and good teaching? Doth not the Law exact perfection of them who are under the Law, when it is impoſſible by reaſon of the infirmity of the fleſh? Is not the rebellion of the fleſh repugnant to the Law of God, from which it is impoſſibe to be freed in this life? In the Covenant of grace, perfection of faith and obedience is commanded, otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection ſhould not be a ſinne: but that is impoſſible to man, whileſt he carries about this body of ſin. And if impoſſible be not the object of Gods will in this ſence, he that by cuſtome in evill hath contracted an habit, that he cannot but ſin, ſhould not offend, and he that is carried with moſt violence of mind unto evill, ſhould be leaſt evill.</p>
               <p>They demand further, how could God approve that ſuch ſhould repent and believe, as doe not theſe things from him, and by the power of his grace, who therefore might glory, as he would have no creature to doe? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. And it is a moſt ſure thing, God would have no creature to glory in himſelfe, and moſt true, that faith will not, cannot glory in any thing, but in the Lord, and therefore we acknowledge that God of his grace hath choſen ſome men to faith and holineſſe, as in juſtice he purpoſed to leave and forſake others for their ſin. For if God decreed not to give men faith and repentance, he is not the authour of them. For God doth nothing in time, but what he decreed to doe before all time. To exclude boaſting it ſufficeth not to ſay, that God gives grace, whereby we might believe, if we will, ſpecially if we uſe our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall gifts well: for that makes ability to believe only to be of God, and that in part procured by our ſelves, but faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be from the free uſe of our owne will, whereby we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from others which believe not, to whom God wiſhed as well, and who received as much grace from God, perhaps more. See <hi>Groven. diſſert. de elect. &amp; fid. praeviſ.</hi> But leaving that matter for the time, to the objection the anſwer is plaine, that as God commandeth wicked men to repent and believe, ſo he teſtifieth what he doth deſire and approve, but with-holding the internall and effectuall working of his Spirit, they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent through their perverſeneſſe. As it is a duty which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, ſo it is approved, but without his grace it cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55916:133"/> It is a certaine truth, if the wicked doe repent unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, they ſhall be accepted, but repentance is the gift of God, which without his grace cannot be wrought. As God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth repentance, ſo he doth approve it, but he approves not that men ſhould glory in themſelves, becauſe if they returne as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, it is by his grace. God teſtified to <hi>Cain</hi> what he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4 7. when <hi>Cain</hi> had not grace at that time to doe what God required: nor did the Lord approve, that he ſhould glory in himſelf, as if he could repent by his own power.</p>
               <p>It may be asked, to what end doth God invite and perſwade wicked men to repent and believe, if he give them not grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve if they will. The latter part of that queſtion muſt be explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for if this be the meaning, that many men through their own default be left of God without grace ſufficient to bring them to life eternall, it is that experience it ſelfe confirmeth, in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels who have departed this life, before they had means to come to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. And if God may deny to ſome both meanes and grace ſufficient to bring them to life eternall, he may juſtly with-hold the graces of his Spirit from them that be called and invited in the Miniſtery of the word, when grace is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, and both the one and other be deprived through their owne default. But if the meaning of that latter clauſe be, that though wicked men ſhould ſeek and truly deſire grace, yet God doth violently with-hold it from them, then it is moſt falſe, and implies a contradiction, as if men without the grace of God, could truly deſire grace. Now the end of this invitation may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the meanes and invitation it ſelfe, and the will<note place="margin">

                  </note> of God exacting of man what is good and acceptable, and what in duty he oweth unto God: and in this reſpect the ſalvation of the party invited is the end of the invitation: or it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered according to the will of God, whereby he doth not only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine and approve meanes to ſuch an end, but will ſo bring to paſſe that the effect ſhall follow: or hereby he not only commands them to believe, and others to further their ſalvation, but willeth effectually to bring them to ſalvation and draw them unto him by the powerfull operation of his Spirit, ſo he doth not will the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all that be called. As men are called to repent that they might live, and God doth in calling them a vow it is his deſire, they would repent that they might live, ſo the end of the invitation is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55916:134"/> life and ſalvation. This is manifeſt, in that the Lord doth earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againe and againe call upon impenitent and obſtinate ſinners to repent and believe, proteſting that he deſires not their death, but rather that they ſhould repent and live, when yet in his juſt and dreadfull judgement he hardeneth their hearts for their perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and rebellion, that they cannot repent. But in reſpect of the good pleaſure of God not to give them grace to repent and believe, which of his rich mercy he gives to others, who have abuſed what they received no leſſe, perhaps more then they, the end is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his juſtice in them, for the contempt of his grace. For what God doth command, intreat, perſwade and promiſe, that he doth will as he doth command, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reat, perſwade and promiſe it. But as God doth juſtly denie that grace to one, which of his free love he vouchſafeth unto another, ſo he willeth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his juſtice in the one ſort, and the riches of his grace in the other.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Some object, that they that are invited muſt either have Chriſt, he not dying for them, or miſſe of Chriſt though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, whereof the former would argue mutability, that Chriſt ſhould die for men, and not die for them, and the latter would be a breach of promiſe. A conceit not much unlike, drove <hi>Socinus</hi> to denie the preſcience of God, becauſe whenceſoever this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience commeth, it is altogether certaine, and from that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily gathered an antecedent neceſſity of all things which are done. <hi>Socin. Praelect. cap.</hi> 8. And in the ſame forme and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a man may reaſon from the preſcience of God, if God approve the repentance and faith of them, whom he doth certainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know to have no portion or benefit by the death of Chriſt, then either if they repent they ſhall have no benefit, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his promiſe, or if they have benefit, then is God deceived, neither of which can be admitted without blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
               <p>And the anſwer to both theſe cavils is one, that certaine it is Chriſt died for them that believe, and whoſoever believeth in him truly and unfainedly, ſhall have benefit by his death: but we need not, we cannot ſay, Chriſt died for them for whom he died not, or that God is changeable: For it is as ſure and true, that they will not repent and believe for whom Chriſt died not. The connexion is good, if the reprobate doe repent and believe unfainedly they
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55916:134"/> ſhall be partakers of the benefits of Chriſts death: but the ſimple Propoſitions are both falſe; the reprobates doe repent, and they are partakers of the ſaving benefits of Chriſts death. Carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings have brought forth ſtrange monſters in Divinity, and in this particular not a few: It is good for us to acknowledge the wiſdome, juſtice, goodneſſe, mercy and truth of God in all his wayes, though we cannot wade into the depth of his counſels. If men give themſelves leave to reaſon thus againſt the proteſtations of the Lord, why doth he intreat and perſwade them to returne? why doth he complaine that they will not come unto him? if he give them not grace to come if they will, if he doe not enable them: Might they not plead as well againſt the fore-knowledge of God in the ſame manner, if God certainly fore-know that men will not returne upon ſuch invitation, why doth he intreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe, ſending his Prophets early, and calling upon them, when by the refuſall of ſuch mercy, they aggravate their ſin, and encreaſe their judgement. Sure amongſt men ſuch a courſe would be accounted idle, unleſſe it was done for a further end. One anſwer will ſuffice to both Objections: but when ſhall we make an end, if we give way to our ignorant and blind ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to the ſecond opinion, which is that Chriſt died, and by his death ſatisfied the juſtice of God for all that have believed, doe believe, or ſhall believe; that they, and they only are partakers of the ſaving benefits of Chriſts death. The death and redemption of Chriſt they deny not to be ſufficient for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation<note place="margin">See <hi>Malder an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſynod. p. 23, 24 Tapper. in ſchol.

For Chriſt the Mediatour of the Covenant of grace, died for them only that be comprehended in the Covenant of grace. His bloud is the bloud of the everlaſting Covenant, of the Covenant that God of his grace hath ſtricken with his Church, and was ſhed for them that have been, are and ſhall be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Covenant. <hi>This is my bloud of the new Testament, which is ſhed for many for remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> For many both Jews and Gentiles, of which the Church was to be gathered. <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, <hi>which is ſhed for you;</hi> and ſo it was ſhed for them, and for many of the ſame ſpirituall eſtate and condition with them, for

The word <hi>many</hi> is uſed for all ſometime, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 19. but here it is uſed rather to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them that be in Covenant, from them that be caſt off, and them to whom remiſſion of ſins purchaſed by the bloud of Chriſt<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 10, 13.</note> is ſealed in the Sacrament, from them to whom it is applyed. The remiſſion of ſinne here ſpoken of, is not put for remiſſibleneſſe, but actuall remiſſion granted and received, for remiſſion in act and application, whereof all are not partakers. If all be taken for the common ſort and poore of the people (which yet may be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and cannot be proved by any paſſage of Scripture, or ſhew of reaſon) and our Saviour uſed that phraſe to teſtifie his aboundant love and humility, in that he ſhed his bloud for the poore and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ranks of men in this world, it makes nothing againſt the former interpretation. For not many mighty, not many noble, but the poore and baſe of this world are called and admitted into<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21.</note> Covenant. But the faithfull only be effectually in Covenant: they that be in Covenant according to the outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, doe profeſſe the faith, and in ſome degree are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in reſpect of converſation: they that be truely and effectually in Covenant, doe ſoundly and unfainedly beleeve.

The Scripture ſpeaketh expreſſely, that Chriſt died for his Church, his ſheep, his children, his people, the people or children of God, thoſe that are given unto him of the Father, his brethren. <hi>As the Father knoweth me, even ſo know I the Father, and I lay downe my life for my ſheep. Joh. 10. 15. Take heed unto your ſelves, and to all the flocke, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud. Act. 20. 28. Chriſt is the head of the Church, and he is the Saviour of the body. Eph. 5. 23. Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelfe for it.</hi> ver. 25. <hi>He ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes.

Joh. 11. 51, 52.

But the inſtance is not like; for theſe words (<hi>for me</hi>) are not disjunctive to diſtinguiſh <hi>Paul</hi> from the reſt of the faithfull, but from unbeleevers, or them that were not in the ſame ſtate or kind. This is a priviledge common to <hi>Paul</hi> with all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, that Chriſt died for him: in reſpect of them then it is not disjunctive, but in reſpect of them who be not partners in that prerogative, it is disjunctive.

The words therefore may be excluſive though only be not added: and that they be reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive is plain by the thing ſignified: for what is it for Chriſt to lay down his life for his ſheep, or to purchaſe his Church by his bloud, but to bruiſe the ſerpents head, to redeeme them from all iniquity, and purifie them to be a peculiar people to himſelfe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This needs no further confirmation then the next anſwer, which they make, that the words be excluſive not in reſpect of the thing it ſelfe, but of the <hi>modus:</hi> which others expreſſe thus, that Chriſt died for his ſheep in reſpect of the application and

That this <hi>Modus</hi> is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, will appeare in that we ſhall never reade that Chriſt died for any but for his ſheep, his Church, his brethren, his people, or them that be conſidered as ſuch in reſpect of preſent profeſſion, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adminiſtration, and application of his benefits. <hi>

The ſeverall paſſages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to prove the univerſality of Chriſts death, have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined already, and found to ſpeake directly to this purpoſe. But amongſt them that be called into, and accept of the Covenant, ſome be elected ſimply, others in compariſon, ſome be the ſheep and brethren of Chriſt in truth and ſincerity, others in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and externall adminiſtration, or in ſome reſpect only. And as we muſt diſtinguiſh of the elect and ſheepe of Chriſt, ſo of his dying for them. For he died for all his elect, as they apply and be partakers of the benefits of his death: he died ſaving-effectually, <hi>ſcil</hi> to bring them to grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; according to the election of grace, for his ſimply elect
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55916:137"/> and people in truth, that is, for them upon whom Salvation ſhould be conferred, and to whom it ſhould be ſoundly applied. So the Prophet telleth us, Chriſt died, that indeed and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 10.</note> he might ſee his ſeed, and bring many brethren unto God. And if Chriſt died not for his ſheepe for this particular end, that by his ſpeciall grace, and that which is given to none others, they<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18. Job, 10. 15.</note> might injoy the fruit of his death, we muſt confeſſe, that Chriſt in this ſaying doth give no particular comfort to his ſheepe, and in that whole Chapter: which is abſurd. And though ſheepe and beleevers materially be the ſame, formally in this place they be not: for when Chriſt ſaith to the Phariſees, <hi>Yee beleeve not, for yee are not of my ſheepe. Joh.</hi> 10. 16. If to be a beleever and the ſheep of Chriſt doe ſignifie the ſame thing, he ſhould ſay, ye beleeve not, and that which followeth, <hi>My ſheepe heare my voice, and follow me, Joh.</hi> 10. 27. ſhould be the ſame as if it had been ſaid, the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers beleeve. So that ſheepe and beleevers are reciprocall, but formally they are not made ſheepe by faith, but by election.</p>
               <p>Moreover the acquiſition of righteouſneſſe by the death of Chriſt, and the application thereof, are things to be diſtinguiſhed, but ſo inſeperably conjoyned, that for whomſoever it is acquired, to them it is applied. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many: for he ſhall beare their iniquities, Iſa. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to reaſon it ſelfe, that Chriſt by the decree of God ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that for men which is not given unto them; that he ſhould acquire what they obtaine not: that by divine imputation Chriſt ſhould die for every man, when the merits of Chriſt be not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them: that the promiſed ſeed ſhould be given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> no bleſſing or multiplication following. If Chriſt have purchaſed a new Covenant, faith, redemption, reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for every man, without queſtion they are or ſhall be delivered from the condemnation and dominion of ſinne; the Spirit is given or ſhall be given to abide with them; they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> or ſhall be renewed after the Image of God. If Chriſt be a King, he hath a Kingdome, ſubjects and territories, wherein he doth exerciſe his regall power. He is a King not only in perſonall right, or to puniſh enemies; but a King to feed and rule a people. God hath given his Sonne the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeſſion, and ſhall men with-hold it? Shall God give men unto Chriſt, and ſhall they detaine themſelves from him? If Chriſt came to deſtroy the workes of the devill, (that is ſinne, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhewes, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 8. Joh.</hi> 8. 41, 44.) and to deliver men from the feare of death and the devill, ſhall we not thinke, that Satan is caſt downe, and death aboliſhed? Chriſt is a Saviour as in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo in efficacy, elſe ſhould his purchaſe be in vaine, the end of his comming into the world be uncertaine, his purpoſe in laying downe his life be fruſtrate, and Chriſt ſhould merit by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, what God doth not give: therfore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of righteouſneſſe muſt not be plucked from the application, nor doth the giving of benefits purchaſed by the death of Chriſt depend upon the pleaſure of men any more then the acquiſition doth. Betwixt the purchaſe and application of Chriſts death,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55916:138"/> faith comes between: but that faith is merited by the death of Chriſt, and for Chriſt vouchſafed to them, for whom he died, <hi>Tit. 3. 6. Epheſ. 1. 3. Phil. 1. 29. Epheſ.</hi> 6. 23.</p>
               <p>Some have anſwered, that all men are the ſheep of Chriſt, as the diſperſed, torne, and devoured of evill paſtors and beaſts of the field, and the ſeduced and deſtroyed are acknowledged to be ſheep, <hi>Jer. 23. 1, 2. Ezek.</hi> 34. 5, 6. But the Prophets ſpeake only of the people of the Jewes, which at that time was diſtinct from the Gentiles, as the flock and inheritance of the Lord: ſo that hence nothing can be gathered, but that they, who live in Chriſts Church and fold, are his people and ſheep of his paſture.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Scripture ſpeakes of the ſheep of Chriſt, two wayes, according to vocation or according to election. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to vocation they are ſheep, who externally pertaine to the number of Gods people and the Church: according to election,<note place="margin">Jer. 23. 3. Rom. 9. 27. Ezek. 34. 5, 6.</note> many ſheep are without, many wolves within, and many ſheep within, many wolves without. Although there be a diſtinction betwixt the merit of Chriſt by his obedience even to death, and his interceſſion, yet one of them cannot be ſeparated from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for he maketh interceſſion for them to his Father for whom he hath merited reconciliation by his death, and we cannot thinke he ſhould lay downe his life for them, for whom he would not pray. If we looke unto the ſignification of the words, Mediatour and Interceſſor note the ſame thing: and if Chriſt have put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe betwixt the wrath of God and man to obtaine reconciliation by making ſatisfaction to offended juſtice, can it be thought, he will not requeſt, that for the virtue of his ſacrifice they for whom he hath ſatisfied, might be accepted of the Father. If we looke to theſe two functions of Mediation, ſuffering death and making interceſſion, they are conjoyned in Scripture. <hi>It is Chriſt that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>died, yea rather that is riſen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us. If any man ſinne we have</hi>

                  <hi>an Advocate with the Father Ieſus Christ the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our our ſinnes.</hi> Chriſt is our Advocate, if he be our propitiation, if we will receive the teſtimony of the Apoſtle and not ſeparate things that God hath conjoyned. Incredible it is, that Chriſt out of his incredible love ſhould vouchſafe to lay downe his life for them as well as others, for whom, the time of his paſſion being at hand, he would not power out a prayer. How
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55916:139"/> theſe two be conjoyned in the intention of our Saviour, ſc. to pray<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 19.</note> for men and to offer himſelfe a Sacrifice for them, may appeare by the words of our Saviour himſelfe, <hi>for theſe I ſanctifie my ſelfe,</hi> that is, for theſe am I prepared to offer my ſelfe, that they might be ſanctified by the truth; <hi>for theſe,</hi> that is, them for whom he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if Chriſt had intended to offer up himſelfe an holy and propitiatory ſacrifice for the ſinnes of all and every man, he would rather have prayed his Father to accept his ſacrifice for all men, then profeſſe that he prayed not for all men. For whom Chriſt hath offered up himſelfe a Sacrifice to put away ſinne, for them doth he appeare before God in heaven: and if he doth appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> God for them, he doth alſo make requeſt for them But Chriſt prayed not for all men, profeſſeth that he prayed not for the world.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 9.</note> He prayed for beleevers and them that ſhould beleeve hereafter, and teſtified that he would not pray for the reſt.

But if we ſearch the Scripture we ſhall find no paſſage that ſaith, Chriſt<note place="margin">Luk. 23. 34.</note> prayed for every man that he might beleeve, nor is probable. For if he aske faith for all men, then abſolutely or conditionally: not abſolutely; for then all men ſhould obtaine faith, becauſe Chriſt was abſolutely heard in whatſoever he abſolutely prayed for. If upon condition, doth he then pray to his Father, that they might not reſiſt the firſt grace offered, or that they might beleeve, if they doe not reſiſt the firſt grace? But if abſolutely he pray that they might not reſiſt, then they doe not reſiſt grace: if conditionally, that they might beleeve, if they doe not reſiſt, then he prayeth that they might beleeve if they beleeve: for not to reſiſt the firſt grace is to obey it, that is, to beleeve.

And when the Goſpell is vouchſafed to ſome that abuſe their naturall gifts, to others not, did our Saviour pray that ſome ſhould have the Goſpell abſolutly, ſome conditionally? or is the Goſpell granted to ſome for the interceſſion of Chriſt, to others without it, although he make interceſſion equally for all men?

But that might be of private duty as man, who ſubjected himſelfe to the Law of God, which requires that we forgive our enemies, and pray for them that perſecute us; not of the proper office of a Mediatour, who was to intercede for his people by ſuffering death and making requeſt. It behoved Chriſt, as he ſubjected himſelfe to the Law, to fulfill all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſo to pray for his enemies, but that was not out of his proper office as Mediatour, which was to offer up himſelfe a Sacrifice or make interceſſion, as our high Prieſt. If any ſhall contend, that this is to be referred to the proper Mediatorie inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Chriſt, it will not prove the matter in hand: for he prayed not for all and every man, but for them that crucified him, and that indefinitely, not univerſally; for them that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at his crucifying, and in ſimplicity of heart (and not of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ignorance (reſiſting the evidence of the Spirit ſpeaking by Chriſt, and by miracles giving teſtimony to his doctrine) in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the commandement of the Superiours, did crucifie him,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55916:140"/> but not for all them that had any hand in his death. He prayeth not that they might beleeve, if they were not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but prayeth for forgiveneſſe for them that had abuſed naturall gifts, and ſupernaturall meanes of grace: ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred to that generall Interceſſion they ſpeake of, with any ſhew of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Some anſwer, the ſenſe of the words is only this, Father ſeeing they have ſinned of ignorance, let them not be puniſhed with that puniſhment, which the thing they have done deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth (which was without all hope to be blinded, hardened, and caſt off) but let them not for this ſin be in this ſtate, but ſhew mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on them, that they may be in poſſibility of repentance, pardon, and grace, which interceſſion anſwereth Chriſts dying, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth all, which was to poſſibilitate their Salvation. But this expoſition is new and ſtraitned, and cannot be confirmed by any circumſtance of the place, or ſignification of the word forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and if it be granted, will not ſute with their purpoſe. For Chriſt died not to poſſibilitate the Salvation of every man, that had or ſhould abuſe naturall gifts and ſupernaturall meanes, as the rulers of the people, which ſtirred up the people to deſire Jeſus that he might be crucified, nor prayed for every man, that had ſo fearfully abuſed the meanes of grace by wilfull and affected ignorance (if not worſe) that he ſhould not be given up to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hardneſſe of heart. If any man ſhall be bold to affirme ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, we muſt deſire better proofe then his bare word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can yeeld aſſent.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, the perſons for whom Chriſt prayed were not in a ſtate capable of remiſſion or pardon, becauſe they were impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">Corvin. in Mol. cap. 27. pag. 7.</note> and unbeleevers, <hi>Corvinus</hi> anſwereth, that we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the condition, if they repent. And by the ſame reaſon, he might aske ſalvation for all men, <hi>ſcil.</hi> if they repent and beleeve. And how then doth this Interceſſion differ from that, which they ſay was ſpeciall for the Salvation of beleevers. Surely to aske the pardon of their ſinnes that repent, doth rather pertaine to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Interceſſion whereby the ſalvation of them that beleeve is prayed for, then to the generall, wherein the faith of all men is craved.</p>
               <p>An example of this generall Interceſſion, wherein Chriſt prayeth that all men might beleeve in him, we have (they ſay)

But becauſe the word world in the whole Chapter is taken in another ſence, it is moſt naturall in this place to underſtand it as before, for men that be of the world, not illightened, or converted to the faith: and the word <hi>Beleeve</hi> to be put improperly for to acknowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. The ſenſe is, that the world, although unbeleeving, although<note place="margin">

This ſenſe is ſo plain and eaſie, that we need not ſeek any further for the meaning: but if we grant it to be meant of true and ſound faith, it will not follow thence, that Chriſt made interceſſion for every man in the world, that he might beleeve.

                  <note place="margin">Armin. Orat. de Sacerdot.

But howſoever it be, the prayer ſpoken of in that place, is abſolute, certain, and effectuall: for what God there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, Chriſt prayed for in particular, and he was heard therein: and therefore it cannot be applyed to that generall Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt which they would maintaine, as every man may plainly ſee.</p>
               <p>They further reply, that this Interceſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the application of Chriſts death; that Chriſt maketh Interceſſion for beleevers: and by the world they are ſignified, who did or would contemne and reject Chriſt offered to them in the word of his Goſpell; as the word world is uſed in many other places. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10. and 3. 19. and 14. 17. &amp; 16. 8, 9. &amp; 14. 22. But if it pertain to the application of Chriſts death, it followeth thence, that the death of Chriſt ſhall be applyed to them, who were given unto him of the Father, that in ſpeciall manner he might lay down his life for them, ſeeing Chriſt offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſacrifice to the Father for them, and them only, for whom according to his office of Mediatorſhip he made ſpeciall Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. If by the world obſtinate contemners of the Goſpell be underſtood, what ſhall we thinke of them to whom the word of reconciliation was never ſent, or Chriſt offered in the Miniſtery of the Goſpell? are they partakers of the benefits of Chriſts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Interceſſion? or is the death of Chriſt applyed unto them? If only contemners of the Goſpell be meant by the world, for
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55916:141"/> which Chriſt would not pray, why ſhould it be interpreted of ſpeciall Interceſſion, ſeeing our Saviour (as they confeſſe) neither laid down his life, nor made generall Interceſſion for ſuch as ſuch, that they might be brought to the faith, or be partakers of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his death? Our Saviour in that his prayer oppoſeth the world to them that are given unto him of the Father, and as to be given unto him of the Father, notes ſomewhat precedent to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall vocation and lively faith, though every one that is given unto him doth or ſhall beleeve, ſo the world notes a ſtate antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to wilfull contempt, though they that be of this world; if they live under the Goſpell, will prove themſelves contemners, <hi>Joh. 6. 37. All that the Father giveth me ſhall come unto me; and him that commeth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. But to come unto Chriſt is to beleeve in him by effectuall vocation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10. The world knew not Chriſt: but they were the world, before they ſhut their eyes againſt the light, and refuſed Chriſt offering himſelfe unto them. <hi>Joh</hi> 3. 19. They are the world who are not given unto Chriſt, are not his ſheep, his people, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, believe not in him, be diſobedient, caſt out, though they never ſtubbornly contemned the Goſpell: becauſe the ſound ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of never came into their eares, that light never ſhined amongſt them. And now for concluſion of this argument, let this one thing be added, that if we ſearch the Scripture we ſhall find no mention of this two-fold Interceſſion of Chriſt properly media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, one generall, the other ſpeciall, which ſome of late have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed: but that he makes Interceſſion for all and every of them that are given unto him of the Father, and only for them, and that his Interceſſion is ever certain and effectuall; as when he ſaith to <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not:</hi> and to all the<note place="margin">Luke 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN the fulneſſe of time, the eternall Sonne of God, took unto him our nature, and became God and Man in one perſon, that he might be an equall middle perſon between God and man. The neceſſity of a Mediatour appeares in this, that man is guilty, and God true and righteous; If man had continued in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, he had ſtood in no need of an expiation: if God had been unrighteous in the paſſages of mans ſinne, there had been due unto him no juſt debt of ſatisfaction. But ſeeing man created good but mutable, did willingly and by voluntary choice tranſgreſſe that Law, under the precepts whereof he was moſt juſtly created, and unto the malediction whereof he was as neceſſarily and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſubject if he tranſgreſſed: and God was purpoſed not to ſuffer ſinne to paſſe utterly unrevenged, becauſe of his great hatred thereunto, and of his truth and the Law which he had eſtabliſhed againſt it: of neceſſity either God muſt execute the ſeverity of his Law, whereby the creature ſhould everlaſtingly looſe the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, and he ſhould likewiſe looſe the ſervice and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubjection of his creature, or ſome courſe or other muſt be found out to tranſlate this mans ſinnes on anothers perſon, who may be able to beare them, and to intereſt this mans perſon in that others righteouſneſſe, which may be able to cover him. Of neceſſity a Mediatour muſt be found out to ſtand between God and man, who muſt have one unto whom, and others for whom and in whoſe behalfe, and ſomewhat wherewith to make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to offended juſtice: In regard of God towards man he muſt be an officer to declare his righteouſneſſe, and in regard of man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God a ſurety ready to procure pardon and deliverance, not by favour or requeſt, but by way of ſatisfaction. He muſt be one with us in the fellowſhip of our nature, paſſions, infirmities
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55916:142"/> and temptations, that ſo he might the more readily ſuffer for us, who in ſo many things ſuffered with us: and one with God the Father in his divine nature, that ſo by the vertue of his ſufferings and reſurrection he might be able both to ſatisfie juſtice, to juſtifie our perſons, to ſanctifie our nature, to purifie and perfume our ſervices, to raiſe our dead bodies, and to preſent us to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a glorious Church without ſpot or wrinkle. He muſt be man pure and undefiled; man, that he might ſuffer, it being no way fit that one having no communion with another, ſhould make ſatisfaction by ſuffering for anothers fault: Man pure and undefiled, otherwiſe he could not have ſatisfied for himſelf, much leſſe for them that had ſo grievouſly offended. He muſt be man, that he might have compaſſion on them that come unto God through him: and pure and undefiled, that his Sacrifice being pure and without ſpot, might be acceptable and pleaſing to provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. He muſt be God that he might beare the weight of Gods wrath without ſinking under it, be the King and Head of the Church, defend his people againſt the enemies of their Salvation, ſend forth his Spirit into the hearts of his redeemed, and receive from them ſuch divine worſhip as was due to ſo great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Saviour. He muſt be man, our neere kinſman, that he might have right of redemption, be a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt, in all things like unto his brethren. He muſt be God, that by his death he might overcome death, and him that had the power of death, that is, the devill, free us from the guilt of ſinne, and curſe of the Law, and preſerve his redeemed unto his everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. He muſt be God and man in one perſon, and ſo of a middle condition between God and us, in that both the natures of God and man doe concurre and are conjoyned in his perſon, that he might joyne God and man in a firme and ſtable Covenant of friendſhip and reconciliation: and be the root, fountaine and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſupernaturall and ſpirituall being, in whom the whole nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55916:143"/> the eternall Sonne of God, being ordained of the Father to this office of Mediatorſhip, that he might intercede between God and man, and joyne God and man in one, did aſſume our nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the unity of his perſon, and was born of a woman, that he might ſave and call ſinners, and redeeme them who were under the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> and ſhut up under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>The ſecond perſon in Trinity, the Son of God by nature, the Image of the Father, by whom all things were made, was made man, that he might renew what was diſordered by ſinne, and make us the ſonnes of God by grace and adoption, who were by nature the children of wrath, it being fit our redemption ſhould be wrought by the Sonne, and ſealed by the holy Spirit. For whereas a double miſſion was neceſſary, the one to reconcile, the other to give gifts to reconciled friends: the Father being of none, ſent his Sonne, the firſt proceeding perſon to take our nature and make ſatisfaction: the Father and the Sonne both ſend the Spirit, the ſecond proceeding perſon, to ſeale up them that Chriſt hath redeemed by his bloud. And who was fitter to become the Sonne of man, then he that was by nature the Sonne of God? who could be fitter to make us the Sonnes of God by grace and adoption, then he that was the Sonne of God by nature? who fitter to repaire the Image of God decayed in us, then he by whom at firſt man was made after the Image of God? Thus Chriſt was a fit and equall middle perſon, conjoyned by the bands of friendly ſociety, and peaceable agreement with both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, God and men, that he might be a Mediatour of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace betweene God and man. He tooke unto him the ſanctified nature of man, that therein he might draw neere unto men, and be the root of them that are ſanctified; and retained the nature of God, that ſo he might not depart from God.</p>
               <p>Here it is queſtioned, according to which nature Chriſt is Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, whether as man only, or as God and man. That he is a Mediatour according to the concurrence of both natures in the unity of his perſon, it is confeſſed by all; for if he were not both God and man, he could not mediate between God and man: but whether he be a Mediatour according to both natures concurring in the worke of Mediation, there be ſome that make queſtion, Our reſolution is, that Chriſt is Mediatour according to both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

If the ſpeciall Offices of Chriſt be conſidered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, much more if all of them be conſidered joyntly, it will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appeare, that both natures muſt neceſſarily concurre in the formall execution of them.

By voluntary diſpenſation Chriſt is Mediatour as God incarnate, and not by nature as God. And according to that diſpenſation Chriſt<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 3, and: 14. 1. 1 Joh. 2, 1, 2.</note> is Mediatour to the Father, who is perſonally called God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in this reſpect, and diſtinguiſhed from Chriſt as Mediatour:
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55916:145"/> and Chriſt is our Advocate to the Father, but never repreſented in Scripture praying to the Son or holy Spirit, but the Father only: which diſpenſation is carefully to be obſerved, from which we muſt not depart upon any vain ſpeculation, which humane curioſity might ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>A Mediatour muſt be a middle perſon, equally diſtant, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually drawing nigh to both parties betwixt whom he doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Chriſt l. 5. c. 2. §.

Ille ſolus eſt verè medius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Deum &amp; hominem, cum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuſq, naturam habeat.</note> And thus Chriſt God incarnate is a fit middle perſon, for he draws as neare to the Father as God, as to us as man, and is as farre diſtant from God as he is man, as he is from us as God: and he comes as neare to the Father, as he departeth from us: and comes as neare to us, as he doth to the Father.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt as a juſt man is not ſo a middle perſon, for he comes not ſo nigh to the Father as juſt, as he doth to us as man; nor is ſo farre diſtant from us as juſt, as he comes nigh to us as man. Then as Mediatour he ſhould be joyned to the Father in will only, but in nature diſ-joyned: and be diſtant from man not in nature, but in quality only: then ſhould he be Mediatour, not as ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially one with the Father, but only as he is united to him in will.</p>
               <p>If it be alleadged, that if Chriſt be Mediatour as God incarnate, then he is Mediatour to himſelfe, becauſe he is God, and then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſhould differ from himſelfe, becauſe a Mediatour is a middle perſon.</p>
               <p>We anſwer, it is not neceſſary a thing ſhould differ from the<note place="margin">Iun. ibid. cap. 5. not. 1, 3, 5, 15.</note> extreames according to all that in reſpect whereof it is of a middle condition, but it is ſufficient if it differ in ſome thing from one, and in ſome thing from another, as is before explained. So the Son of God incarnate by voluntary diſpenſation differeth not only from the Father and the holy Ghoſt, but from himſelfe as God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>ſcil.</hi> as man he differeth from himſelfe as God, and as God from himſelfe as man. The whole Trinity being offended with us for ſin, was to be pacified, but the Scripture teacheth, Chriſt was our Mediatour to the Father: and we muſt ſilence our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and learne of God what to believe. And aſſuredly if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be reconciled, the whole Trinity is reconciled. And further it may be added, that he who according to abſolute eſſence or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the partie offended, may according to voluntary diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuſtaine the perſon and doe the office of a Mediatour: and ſo
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55916:145"/> Chriſt was primarily a Mediatour to the Father for us, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and ſecundarily to the whole Trinity, and ſo to himſelfe as God.</p>
               <p>It is further objected, if Chriſt be Mediator according to his divine nature, then all three perſons in Trinity be Mediatours: but this is a meere deceit: for the divine nature is taken eſſentially for the divine nature common to Father, Son and holy Ghoſt: or perſonally for the divine eſſence conſidered diſtinctly in the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt: In the latter ſence we ſay, Chriſt according to his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is our Mediator, as he was incarnate, and did aſſume our nature unto his divine perſon, and not the Father or the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But then (it will be ſaid) he was inferiour to the Father: In office it is true, by voluntary diſpenſation he is inferiour, but in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Iun. ibid. not. 13.</note> he is equall to the Father: and nothing hinders but one equall to another in nature, may by voluntary and free choice under-take<note place="margin">Phil, 2. 6, 7.</note> an office of inferiority. <hi>Being in the forme of God, he humbled himſelfe.</hi> The Scripture teacheth expreſſely, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 18. &amp; 3. 16. &amp; 3. 13.

And as God is manifeſted in Chriſt, ſo was he manifeſted and made knowne by Chriſt. In Chriſt are hid<note place="margin">Col. 1. 3. Epheſ. 3. 9, 10.</note> all the treaſures of wiſdome, and he hath made knowne the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wiſdome of God. The diſcovery of miſery and ſin is that which ſweetens mercy, and gaines it eſteem: and therefore as the mercy of God was plentifully unfolded, ſo was the Law laid open, and ſin diſcovered by our Saviour more fully then it had been in the old Teſtament, that as ſin abounded, mercy might abound much more. And where the maladie appeares hideous and deſperate, there is need that we be well acquainted with the ſoveraigne reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and hence as the doore of the Law and curſe is caſt quite open, that men might throughly know themſelves, ſo Chriſt in his perſon, natures, office and benefits is lively deciphered, that when men feele themſelves loſt in themſelves, they might runne unto him for righteouſneſſe, grace, life and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt hath ſatisfied offended juſtice, and anſwered whatſoever the Law had againſt us. The word ſatisfaction the Scripture hath not, but the thing ſignified thereby is plainly noted by the phraſes of Redemption, Expiation, Reconciliation, and many ſuch like every where in Scripture. Juſtice did releaſe the debtour, or the puniſhment of the perſon offending: but would not ſimply releaſe the puniſhment of the offence, or pardon the fault without ſatisfaction. If then the guilty be ſpared, the ſurety muſt ſuffer puniſhment.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:55916:146"/>
               <p>It is here queſtioned, whether God could not pardon ſin without ſatisfaction, or ſatisfaction be abſolutely neceſſary, the decree and pleaſure of God ſo to have it excepted.</p>

For theſe and ſuch like reaſons many have thought, that it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely repugnant to divine juſtice to pardon ſin without ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Others and thoſe learned and orthodox are of opinion, that the neceſſity of ſatisfaction depends upon the will and pleaſure of God, and that God by his abſolute power, <hi>ſalva juſtitia,</hi> might have pardoned ſin without ſatisfaction.

And if God by abſolute neceſſity muſt puniſh ſin as it deſerveth, then it is ſimply impoſſible to renew the ſinner by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or to annihilate him, becauſe then he doth not bear what puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t his ſin doth call for from the hand of juſtice. Juſtice is eſſentiall to God, ſo is mercy, bounty, libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: but God ſheweth mercy to whom he will &amp; doth good to whom he will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not by abſolute neceſſity: only God hath obliged himſelfe by righteouſneſſe of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, that is by promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which muſt be fulfilled, to doe this or that. Sin though it hath an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſagreement, ſuch as may be in a creature from the Creator: yet it hath no inward poſitive repugnancy or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy to Gods nature, ſuch as is betwixt fire and water: for then ſhould the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature inwardly in it ſelfe be worſe for the being of ſin, and ſhould neceſſarily nill it.

The hatred of ſin and puniſhment thereof are joyned together as a free cauſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, not as a neceſſary cauſe and effect: for God hateth ſin at all times, but puniſheth it not ever, but in his time or ſeaſon.

For hereby God manifeſteth his juſt indignation againſt ſin, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the riches of his grace and tender compaſſion towards the ſinner, whom he is pleaſed to ſave from deſerved wrath. Seeing then God decreed not to deliver man from the ſentence of death contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by ſin, but upon ſatisfaction made to divine juſtice, and the puniſhment of ſin borne by his ſurety, of neceſſity if Chriſt become a Mediatour to intercede for us, he muſt undertake to pay our debts, and in our roome and ſteed to ſuffer what we deſerved. And as he undertook, ſo he hath borne the chaſtiſement of our peace, and by bearing the puniſhment hath taken away our ſins.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt did under-goe the puniſhment due to ſinners, as their ſurety, is evident in this, that he died for us. <hi>For the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23 &amp; 5. 12. which God inflicteth upon none but either a ſinner, or him that beareth the perſon of a ſinner:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 15. 21, 22.

Hitherto it makes, that he ſuffered not any kind of death whatſoever, but ignominious, violent, judiciall and accurſed, ſuch as had the ſence of Gods wrath adjoyned. For no reaſon can be imagined, why Chriſt ſhould ſo much dread death, which the Martyrs endured without feare, but that for the time he was deprived of that refreſhing of divine grace and favour wherewith they were ſuſtained and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 8, 9.</note> in the midſt of the fire.

                  <hi>Melchizedech, Pſal. 110. 4. Heb.</hi> 7. 14, 15. who hath offered up himſelfe a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 2. and ſanctified us by one offering up of himſelfe once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 11, 12. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſacrifice of Chriſt may be conſidered, either as he offered<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 13, 23.</note> up himſelfe for all the faithfull in generall, his ſheep, and Church, or as every particular faithfull man is comprehended under that univerſality, and the good things purchaſed for all, tend to the ſalvation of every ſingular beleever, God would have the firſt ſhould be ſhadowed forth by the anniverſary ſacrifice, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were offered for all the people: the latter by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſacrifices of every ſinner, <hi>Lev. 5. Exod.</hi> 29. 30. Chriſt then as Mediatour by his death hath made ſatisfaction for us, and that true, full, reall ſatisfaction, and not by a certaine fiction of Law or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine acceptilation, as they call it. For why did God exact the bloody death of his Sonne, if it had pleaſed him to reſt in any light ſatisfaction? The Apoſtle concludes, the ſacrifice of Chriſt to be neceſſary, becauſe it is impoſſible the blood of Bulls and Goats ſhould doe away ſinnes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4. which argument concludes not, if Chriſt hath ſatisfied only, as it pleaſed the Father to accept of his imperfect ſatisfaction, as if it had been perfect. The ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt was free, becauſe he was freely given to ſatisfie, but the decree of God preſuppoſed to ſhew his mercy and juſtice, full ſatisfaction was neceſſary: becauſe ſinne muſt be puniſhed as the Law requireth, or God is not true as in his promiſes, ſo in his threatnings. None other wages is appointed for ſinne but death,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> hence he that is dead is juſtified from ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 7. But Chriſt ſuffered death, and by death made recompence to juſtice for our debt: and in that he died for ſinne, he died once, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9, 10. He taſted death, that by death he might deſtroy him that had the<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9, 14, 15.</note> power of death, that is, the devill, and deliver them who through feare of death were all their life ſubject to bondage. But when the Scripture nameth death generally, it comprehends all that which God threatned in that ſentence, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death:</hi> that penall death, which is the reward of ſinne, but not ſinne it ſelfe: which is penall only, not ſinfull. Other mens debts are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered diverſe wayes: ſome anſwer them ſimply as redeemers, ſome as ſureties. He that anſwers them as a ſuretie, muſt pay the<note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 6.</note> ſame ſumme of money that the debtor oweth. Now Chriſt is not only our Mediatour, but our ſuretie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and hence the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55916:151"/> of Chriſt is called a propitiation. <hi>Rom. 3. 25. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 2. and the ſurety is of debt and juſtice to make full ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath voluntarily promiſed it, and God the Father did in juſtice exact it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. and 8. 32.</p>
               <p>In the ſufferings of Chriſt we muſt conſider the circumſtances, and ſubſtance of his ſufferings. The circumſtances, as the perſon of the ſufferer, the cauſe of ſuffering, and efficacy of the paſſion: in which reſpect it was more then the Law required: for the Law did not require that God ſhould die, nor that any one ſhould die that had not finned, nor ſuch a death, and of ſuch efficacie, as not only to aboliſh death, but to bring in life, and that by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more excellent then that which <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt: but if we reſpect the ſubſtance of puniſhment, it was that which the Law required, which he paid of love free and voluntary, and yet of juſtice. Juſtice requireth the ſame ſumme of debt, the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſts perſon nothing hindering: and according to juſtice Chriſt made ſatisfaction. As concerning the ſubſtance of puniſhment, Chriſt ſuffered what was due to us, but in the circumſtances, which pertained not to the ſubſtance of the debt, ſome thing was pardoned, to the dignity of the perſon. In this ſtands the dignity of Chriſts perſon, that he might be fit meritoriouſly to pay our debt, ſo farre was it from freeing or acquitting him for any part of our debt. <hi>He that knew no ſinne, was made ſinne for us, 2 Cor. 5. 21. Surely he hath born our griefes, and carried our ſorrowes. Iſai.</hi> 53. 4. When the Scripture ſpeakes ſo fully, why ſhould humane curioſity limit the ſufferings of Chriſt, as if they were not fully ſatisfactory, but by divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptilation only? Chriſt ſuffered not every particular puniſhment that every particular ſinner meeteth withall: but his paſſion was a common price payed at once for all his people, ſatisfying juſtice for all their offences, <hi>Rom. 5. 19. Heb. 10. 14. Rom. 8. 33. He bore our ſinnes in his body upon the tree. 1 Pet. 2. 24. We are redeemed by his bloud. Eph. 1. 7. The bloud of Christ cleanſeth us from all ſinne. 1 Joh. 1. 6. Phil. 2. 8.

                  <hi>of the croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the puniſhments which Chriſt ſuffered, they were not ordinary, but beyond meaſure grievous, bitter and unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yea, ſuch as would have made any meere creature to ſinke down under the burthen of them to the bottome of hell. For he
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55916:152"/> ſuffered grievous things from all the things in heaven, earth and hell. He ſuffered at the hands of God his Father, and of men; of Jewes, of Gentiles, of enemies inſulting, of friends forſaking, of the Prince of darkneſſe, and all his cruell and mercileſſe inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But whereas of the puniſhments of ſinne, ſome be ſinnes and puniſhments both, others puniſhments only: and ſome common to the nature of man, others perſonall growing out of ſome imperfection and defect in the vertue and faculty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the body, diſorder in diet, or ſome violence offered: and ſome for ſinne inherent, others for ſinne imputed: Our Saviour Chriſt ſuffered the puniſhments that are only puniſhments, and not ſinne, common to the whole nature of man, not perſonall to this or that man; the puniſhments of the ſinnes of other men, not his own, and that of them that ſhould breake off their ſins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, not of them that would ſin for ever, if they might live for ever. The whole life of our Saviour was a life of ſuffering, but his ſpeciall ſufferings were thoſe he endured in the Garden, or upon the croſſe. In the Garden he was in an agony: upon the croſſe he was preſſed with the weight of grievous and unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evils. His agony was that ſorrow, wherein his ſoule was beſet round with heavineſſe and feare even unto death. Thus the Evangeliſts deſcribe it, <hi>He began to be ſorrowfull, and very heavy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Then ſaith he to them,</hi> ſcil. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John, My ſoul is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſorrowfull, even unto death. He began to be ſore amazed, and to be very heavy, And ſaith unto them, My ſoule is exceeding ſorrowfull</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14. 33, 34. Joh. 12. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>unto death. Now is my ſoul troubled.</hi> His ſoul was ſmitten with horrour, that all powers and faculties for a time left their proper functions, and did concurre to relieve nature in that extremity; as when a man hath received ſome gaſhly wound, the bloud doth at firſt retire to comfort the heart. But this ſtay came not from any internall defect, which had been ſinfull, but from an externall cauſe, to wit, the horrour which fell upon him, as the wheeles of a Watch may ceaſe from motion without any fault in them, when they are ſtayed by the hand of the Artificer. He feared alſo the ſtroke of the juſtice of God his Father, ſitting on the Tribunall or Judgement ſeat, to puniſh the ſins of men, for whom he ſtood forth to anſwer; this he feared, as a thing impoſſible to be eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, in reſpect of the reſolution and purpoſe of God his Father, that by his ſatisfactory death, and no other way, man ſhould be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:55916:152"/> delivered. And he declined everlaſting deſtruction, as a thing he knew he ſhould eſcape without all doubt or uncertaintie of event, though not without conflicting with the temptations of Sathan, and the enduring of many grievous and bitter things.</p>
               <p>Theſe paſſions in Chriſt were moſt pure, becauſe he himſelfe was moſt free from all taint of ſin, as if you put cleare water into a cleare glaſſe, though you ſhake and ſtirre it never ſo much, it will raiſe no mud.</p>
               <p>The effects of this agony were two; Earneſt prayer and bloudie ſweat. <hi>Being in an agony he prayed more fervently. He</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22 44.</note> 
                  <hi>fell on his face and prayed:</hi> He prayed thrice the ſame words, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me: nevertheleſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 26. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> As the ſenſe of nature and inferiour reaſon preſented death, and the ignominy of the croſſe unto him, as they are in themſelves evill, without the conſideration of any good to follow, he deſired to decline them. But as ſuperiour rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon conſidered them with all circumſtances, knowing Gods reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to be ſuch, that the world ſhould thereby be ſaved, and by no other meanes, he moſt willingly accepted of them. Between theſe deſires there was a diverſity, but no contrariety: a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but no repugnance or reſiſtance. Conſider Chriſt in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as a man, of the ſame naturall affections, deſires and abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with other men, and the cup as it was very bitter and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and ſo moſt juſtly he feared and declined it, and could not but decline it, unleſſe he had put off the nature and affection of man: But conſider him in his publike relation, as a Mediatour, a ſuretie, a mercifull and faithfull high Prieſt, and ſo he moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and obediently ſubmitted unto it. And this willingneſſe in reſpect of his office was much the greater, and the comfort we may draw from thence the ſweeter, becauſe in reſpect of nature, his will could not but ſhrinke for it. If nature had not neceſſarily ſhrunke, ſweat ſtartled, and ſtood amazed at that ſervice, Chriſt had not manifeſted ſo much love and free ſubmiſſion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of grace, nor could we have had ſo much comfortable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of our redemption thereby: for it is impoſſible the nature of man ſhould conflict with the terrible wrath of God, and not dread and tremble.

               <p>The ſecond effect of this Agonie was a bloudie ſweat. In a cold night, when our Saviour lay upon the ground, in the open aire, no man being neere unto him, no violence offered unto his body, he did ſweat clotted bloud, in ſuch abundance, that it ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through his apparell, and wet the ground.

                  <hi>God, why hast thou forſaken me?</hi> He complaineth not that his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father had forſaken his, but him. Formerly he had wept over Jeruſalem, and commended his Diſciples unto the cuſtody<note place="margin">Joh. 17.</note> of his Father, being aſſured they ſhould be gathered, though for the time diſperſed. But the cauſe of this lamentation was, that being now in the hands of his cruell, bloudy, mercileſſe enemies, left to endure the extremity of their rage and fury, his Father for a time withdrew from him that ſolace he was wont to find in him. The unity of his perſon was never diſſolved, his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or graces were never either taken away or diminiſhed: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it poſſible he ſhould want aſſurance of future deliverance and preſent ſupport: but for a time the Father did with-draw the ſenſe of favour and comfort, that his humane nature might ſuffer what our ſinnes deſerved. This dereliction was altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; becauſe Chriſt our Saviour brought it not upon himſelfe, but was called unto it, and in the conflict his faith was moſt firm, not ſhaken with any degree of unbelief: in which caſes only the want of comfort is a fault, <hi>ſcil.</hi> when we bring it upon our ſelves, or ſtain it with infidelity.</p>
               <p>It is here objected, that an innocent perſon ought not to ſuffer for a nocent, for guilt is inſeparable from ſin; <hi>The ſonne ſhall not beare the iniquity of his Father, neither ſhall the Father beare the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the ſon, the ſoul that ſinneth the ſame ſhall die. Ezek.</hi> 18. 20.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of this objection, we muſt note, that there is a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55916:153"/> two-fold manner of guilt, either ſuch as growes out of ſin inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which is the deſerving of puniſhment, as it is in us: or ſuch as growes out of ſin imputed, and that not by reaſon of union natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; as the guilt of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin is imputed unto us (which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of imputation likewiſe is the foundation of puniſhment deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) but voluntary by way of vadimonie and ſuſception. And ſo guilt is only a free and willing obnoxiouſneſſe unto that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which another hath deſerved. In an ordinary courſe of providence it is true, the ſonne ſhall not beare the puniſhment of the Fathers ſin; becauſe he is altogether perſonally diſtinct, he is not appointed ſo to doe, as Chriſt was, he is not able to bear them ſo as to take them off from his Father, as Chriſt did ours, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hath too many of his own to beare: but this was no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or unchangeable Law, and if the will of the Sonne go along with the Father in ſinning, it is not ſtrange, not unuſuall for him to ſuffer for his Fathers and his own ſin together, as for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the ſame offence. More particularly for reſolution of the queſtion, whether an innocent perſon may ſuffer for the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we muſt note, firſt that God out of his dominion over all things, may caſt paines upon an innocent perſon, as it is manifeſt he did upon Chriſt, who ſuffered moſt grievous things, and death it ſelfe; And what ground of complaint could any creature have againſt God, if he ſhould have created it in fire, and made the place of its habitation, the inſtrument of its pain? Do not we our ſelves without cruelty, upon many occaſions put creatures that have not offended us, unto pain?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not univerſally againſt equity for one to ſuffer the puniſhment of anothers ſin: We ſee the Infants of Sodome, Babylon, Egypt, of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were involved in the puniſhment of thoſe ſins of which themſelves were not guilty. The Lord reſerveth to himſelfe the puniſhment of the Fathers upon the children. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. and 34. 7. He puniſhed the ſinnes of three hundred and ninetie yeares all together. <hi>Ezek.</hi>

For it is eſſentiall to puniſhment that it ſhould be inflicted for ſinne, but not that it ſhould be inflicted upon him that hath offended.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that an innocent perſon may thus in juſtice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuffer for a nocent, there is required (beſides the acts of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſupreme, of ſubmiſſion in the ſuretie, and of conſent in<note place="margin">Actus cui poena ineſt, eſt actus nocivus: qui nec omnibus, nec in omnes conceſſus.

So the ſurety is puniſhed for the debtor. Poſſeſſorie, as between a man and his goods, and ſo we find that a man was to offer no beaſt for a ſin-offering, but that which was his own. <hi>Lev.</hi> 5. 6, 7. Beſides, there is required in the innocent perſon ſuffering, that he have a free and full dominion over that from which he parteth, in his ſuffering for another. As in ſuretiſhip, a man hath free dominion over his money, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55916:154"/> in that reſpect he may engage himſelf to pay another mans debt; but he hath not a free dominion over himſelf, or his own life; and therefore he may not part with a member of his own in commutation, for anothers, (as <hi>Zaleucus</hi> did for his ſonne) nor be <gap reason="foreign">

Now all theſe things hold in Chriſt in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner. There is a moſt neere conjunction between him and us. He converſed amongſt men, and was a member of that Tribe and Society amongſt whom he lived, and therefore was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them under that Romane yoke which was then upon the people, and in that relation paid tribute unto <hi>Ceſar:</hi> He had the nature of man, and was ſubject to all humane and naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities without ſinne. He was myſtically married unto his Church, and therefore was anſwerable for the debts and miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours of his Church. He entred into Covenant, and became ſurety for man, and therefore was liable to mans engagements. He became the poſſeſſion in ſome ſort of his Church, whence it is that we are ſaid to have him. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. not by way of dominion (for ſo we are his. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19.) but by way of communion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. He was Lord of his own life, and had therefore power to lay it down, and to take it up. And this power he had (though he were in all points ſubject to the Law as we are) not ſolely by vertue of the hypoſtaticall union, which did not for the time exempt him from any obligations of the Law, but by vertue of a particular command, conſtitution, and deſignation to that ſervice of laying down his life. <hi>This commandement have I received of my Father. Joh.</hi> 10. 18. Moreover, he had power ample enough to breake thorough the ſufferings he undertooke, and to aſſume his life, and former condition again. <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up.</hi> And therefore it was moſt juſt and righteous, that Chriſt in himſelf innocent, ſhould ſuffer for us in our ſelves guilty, which doth more plainly appeare, in that all parties are glorified, and all parties are willing and well-pleaſed. All parties are glorified: The Father is glorified in the obedience of his Sonne. <hi>Joh. 12. 27, 28. John</hi> 17. 4. The Sonne is glorified by the Father. <hi>Joh. 17. 5. Heb.</hi> 2. 7. crowned with glory: and the ſinner glorified, being received into favour. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 24.

The Sonne is willing, he cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted unto it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. and freely loved us, and gave himſelf unto us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. The ſinner is willing, and accepteth and relieth upon it. The ſumme of all is this, By the moſt wiſe, juſt, and mercifull will of God, by his owne moſt obedient and voluntary ſuſception, Chriſt Jeſus, being one with us in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold and moſt ſecret union, and having full power to lay downe, and to take up his life again, by ſpeciall command and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Father given him, did moſt juſtly, without injury to himſelf, or diſhonour to or injuſtice in his Father, ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of their ſins, with whom he had ſo neere an union, and who could not themſelves have ſuffered them with obedience in their own perſons, or with ſo much glory to Gods juſtice, mercy and wiſdome. And though the will of God being ever juſt, is to us a ſufficient cauſe of what God willeth, and the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be to us unſearchable: yet in this matter we can aſſigne juſt and weighty reaſons of this will of God out of the Scriptures. God will not execute the ſeverity of his Law, becauſe he is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſlow to anger, and ready to forgive. His free and everlaſting love, and infinite delight which he hath in mercy, diſpoſeth him aboundantly to pardon, and exerciſe loving kindneſſe in the earth. <hi>Exod. 34. 7. Micha 7. 18.

They that have written of the relaxation of<note place="margin">Proxima ſunt idem ac tantun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</note> Lawes doe note, that thoſe relaxations are beſt, to which ſome commutation or recompence is annexed: becauſe by that meanes the authority of the Law is preſerved, and obedience given to that reaſon, which was the cauſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>And hence we may gather a ſecond reaſon, why God would not pardon ſinne without ſatisfaction, ſc. his truth and the Law which he had eſtabliſhed againſt ſinne, which he will in no wiſe aboliſh: <hi>one jot or title ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the Law, till all be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, Matth.</hi> 5. 18. For it is altogether undecent, eſpecially to the wiſedome and righteouſneſſe of God, that that which provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the execution, ſhould procure the abrogation of his Lawes, that that ſhould ſupplant and undermine the Law, for the alone preventing whereof the Law was before eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Alſo God will have men alwayes to tremble before him, and by his terror to be perſwaded from ſinning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10, 11. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſerveth to himſelfe entire the puniſhment of ſin, that men might alwayes feare before him, <hi>Matth. 10. 28. Luk.</hi> 12. 4. The omiſſion of puniſhment after the publication of the Law, doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſomewhat from the authority of the Law, with the ſubjects: God therefore willing to ſhew mercy to the creature fallen, and with all to maintaine the authority of his Law, tooke ſuch a courſe as might beſt manifeſt his clemency and ſeverity, his hatred of ſin, care to ſtabliſh the Law, and tender compaſſion towards them that had gone aſtray. And hereby the love of God towards them that are ſpared is the more illuſtrious, that he ſpared them, who rather then he would not puniſh ſinne, would give his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne to die for ſinne.</p>
               <p>It is objected againe, that God doth freely remit and pardon ſinne, therefore he willed not that Chriſt ſhould make ſatisfaction: becauſe free remiſſion will not ſtand with ſatisfaction. And moſt ſure it is, that God is favourable to our iniquities, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 34. but God hath ſet forth Chriſt to be a propitiation through faith in his bloud. <hi>Rom. 3. 25. Act. 10. 43.

Another of a thing not altogether the ſame, which is in the obligation, ſo that ſome act of the Creditour or Governor muſt come unto it, which is called remiſſion: in which caſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance doth not follow <hi>ipſo facto</hi> upon the ſatisfaction.

Remiſſion therefore is not repugnant to antecedent ſatisfaction: but only to that paiment of the thing due, which <hi>ipſo facto</hi> doth deliver and ſet free.</p>
               <p>It may be added that of grace Chriſt was ordained to be our ſurety, that at the commandment of grace he made ſatisfaction, and that his mind and will in ſatisfying was, that grace might juſtly glorifie her ſelfe in pardoning offences, and not that pardon ſhould be given of juſtice. And ſo the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is full and perfect, and our pardon is every way free and gracious. And ſeeing every one may impoſe a Law to the act depending upon his own free will and pleaſure, he that prayeth for another, and he that admitteth the paiment of one thing for another, may cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that remiſſion ſhall follow preſently, or after a certaine time, purely or upon condition. And this was the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Chriſt making ſatisfaction, and of God admitting ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and this the Covenant, that God ſhould pardon ſin, not preſently in the very time of Chriſts paſſion, but when man is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto God by true faith in Chriſt, humbly intreating pardon. To forgive ſin, is not oppoſite to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> accepting of that ſatisfaction which is freely admitted, when it might be refuſed, and to which
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:55916:156"/> he upon whom the benefit undue is conferred, doth conferre nothing.</p>
               <p>It is further objected, that Chriſt ſatisfied not juſtice fully, but by divine acceptilation only: becauſe he ſuffered but for a time, whereas we deſerved to die eternally.</p>
               <p>Sundry anſwers are made to this doubt. Some ſay his ſuffering for a time was more then if all man-kind had ſuffered eternally, in reſpect of the excellency of his perſon. But the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of his perſon, was neither to diſpence with time, nor grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſſe of his puniſhments, but to make the paſſion of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable for many. Otherwiſe if it might have diſpenſed with one degree of extremity of puniſhment due to ſin, it might alſo have diſpenſed with two, and conſequently with all.</p>
               <p>Others anſwer, that the puniſhments of ſin eternally remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, muſt according to the rules of divine juſtice, be eternall: but it is no way neceſſary, neither doth the juſtice of God require, that the puniſhments of ſin repented of, ceaſing and forſaken, ſhould be everlaſting. For as Divines note, there are three things to be conſidered in ſin; the averſion from an infinite and incommutable good; the inordinate converſion to a finite good, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in the ſame, or ceaſing from it: and to theſe ſeverall things in ſin, there are three ſeverall things anſwering in the puniſhment of it. For to the averſion, which is objectively infinite, there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth the loſſe of God, which is an infinite loſſe. To the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate converſion of the ſinner to things tranſitory, there anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſenſible ſmart and griefe intenſively finite, as the pleaſure the ſinner taketh in the tranſitory things he inordinately loveth is finite. To the eternity of ſin remaining everlaſtingly in ſtaine or guilt, or continuance of it for a time, anſwereth the eternity of puniſhment, or the ſuffering of the ſame, but for a time. Now our Saviour Chriſt ſuffered only for thoſe ſins, which he meant to breake off by framing the ſinners to repentance, and therfore it was no way neceſſary for the ſatisfying of divine juſtice, that he ſhould endure eternall puniſhment.</p>
               <p>A third anſwer is, that Chriſt ſuffered for a time, becauſe he ſuffered to ſatisfie, and ſo to overcome upon the croſſe, he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed meritoriouſly over principalities and powers, therefore his ſufferings could not continue for ever, but muſt have an end. For in ſuffering he had not ſatisfied juſtice, nor conquered the enemies
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55916:157"/> of our ſalvation, if he had lien under the puniſhment of our ſins e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. But this ſheweth the reaſon why Chriſt ſuffered but for a time, rather then how his ſuffering for a time could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the juſtice of God for ever, which had deſerved eternall death.</p>
               <p>The fourth anſwer is more full and free from exception, that Chriſt ſuffered but for a time, becauſe it was impoſſible he ſhould be held under of the ſorrows of death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. The wicked ſuffer eternally, becauſe they being caſt under the curſe, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deliver themſelves, and juſtice will not ſet them free: but Chriſt in ſuffering did overcome, and delivered himſelfe, ſo that his ſufferings continued but for a time.

It is not abſurd to ſay, the elect are in grace with God in reſpect of ordination or appointment; but after are brought into grace by Chriſt in reſpect of the actuall collation and communication. When Chriſt is ſaid to reconcile us unto God, the meaning is not, that God did then firſt begin to love, or will well unto us, as if he did hate and will to damne us before: for then we muſt admit a proper change in the purpoſe and internall will of God proceeding from an externall cauſe,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55916:157"/> which is contrary both to Scripture and ſound reaſon: but whereas formerly we lay under wrath deſerved by ſin, now we are recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into favour and friendſhip with God. For reconciliation is a tranſient act, done in time, which inferrs a change in the creature reconciled, a change of ſtate, not of qualities, and followes the obedience of Chriſt, as the effect the cauſe, and which God impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to believers. Reconciliation, as the Scripture ſpeaks of it, imports not any change in God, nor the externall good will or love of God, which remains in himſelfe, and worketh not any change in the creature: but a bleſſing granted to us in time, that we who were the children of wrath by nature, ſhould be the Sons of God by grace; we who were enemies, and hated in reſpect of the effects of wrath, and deſert of ſin, ſhould be made friends and deare to God, the enmity being taken away by the bloud of Chriſt. And from hence we may learne how the new Covenant in many things hath the prerogative above the old. For wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> mediated it was by the power of Chriſt, but Chriſt was that one Mediatour, who mediated from his owne authority and immediate power. <hi>Moſes</hi> was called by God and the people, but an imperfect Mediatour, as not a right middle perſon: but Chriſt was a fit middle perſon both God and man, partaking the nature both of the offending and offended party, and ſo a middle perſon not only in office, but in nature, willing and fitting to mediate. <hi>Moſes</hi> by reaſon of his weakneſſe, was neither powerfull with God, nor yet fully compaſſionate and powerfull with the people: But Chriſt was man for the whole body of his brethren to prevaile for them: and man with his brethren, to be fully ſenſible and compaſſionate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. Againe, he was man with God to preſent a perfect ranſome or price of reconciliation: and he was God with man to bow them ſufficiently to accept the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offered. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in need to mediate for himſelfe, as for the people: but Chriſt having no controverſie for himſelfe, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated only for the people, and hath perfected, wherin <hi>Moſes</hi> wanted. For he fully bowes and circumciſeth the hearts of his brethren to ſeeke attonement and to walke ſutably: He doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the guilt of ſinfully from the conſcience of the offending bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 14, 15. He is potent with God to ſatisfie revenging<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13, 14.</note> juſtice by preſenting his bloud to remove the curſe of the Law, that thoſe which are called might receive the inheritance. He alone
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55916:158"/> hath in his owne perſon performed obedience to the broken Law of God, and fulfilled all righteouſneſſe: and by his croſſe hath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the hand-writing that was againſt us, and broken downe the partition, and ſlayed hatred and enmity betwixt the brethren, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 14, 15. But of this more hereafter. The Fathers recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13, 14.</note> not the promiſes, but ſaw them afarre off, and were perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them, and ſaluted them with great ſweetneſſe: but under the new Covenant we have recived the promiſe, God hath ſent his Son into the world, borne of a woman, and made under the Law, and openly manifeſted him to be the Son of God. And if<note place="margin">Gal 4. 4, 5.</note> the appearing of Chriſt God and man, did adde much to the joy and comfort of the Saints in glory: the manifeſtation of Chriſt in the fleſh muſt adde to the faith and comfort of them, that waited for the ſalvation of Iſrael. The Incarnation of Chriſt was the day of his Coronation, and of his eſpouſals, wherein in ſpeciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 11.</note> he contracted him unto his Church. <hi>Goe forth, O ye daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion, and behold King Salomon with the crowne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his mother crowned him in the day of his espouſals, and in the day of the gladneſſe of heart.</hi> The Fathers expected deliverance from the curſe of the Law, and to inherit the promiſes in and through the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> and the Sacrifices did prefigure, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets fore-tell the death of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> but we may well thinke, the faithfull did not diſtinctly underſtand, how the Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, was to ſatisfie juſtice, and by death to overcome him that had the power of death. But in the new Teſtament we learne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely, that Chriſt is made of God unto us wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſanctification and redemption, how he ſatisfied juſtice by one oblation of himſelfe, removed the curſe of the Law, deſtroyed him that had the power of death, purchaſed the promiſed Spirit, and ratified all the promiſes of the Covenant by his death and bloud-ſhed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is entred into heaven, appeareth before the Father, and maketh requeſt for his people: unto which there is pre-requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a power and prevalencie over all his enemies, to breake through the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the Law, and the chaines of death, with which it was impoſſible that he ſhould be held. And this power of Chriſt was ſhewed in his Reſurrection, wherein he was declared to be the Son of God with power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 4. and in his aſcenſion, wherein he led all his enemies captives, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 8. and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55916:158"/> in his ſitting at the right hand of God, farre above all principalities and powers, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20.

               <p>It conſiſteth in two things; Firſt, his appearing or preſenting of his perſon in our nature and in his owne, as a publike perſon, a Mediatour, a ſponſor and pledge for us; as <hi>Judah</hi> was both a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour to requeſt, and a ſurety to engage himſelfe to beare the blame for ever with his Father for his brother <hi>Benjamin, Gen. 43. 8, 9.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus</hi> a Mediatour, <hi>I beſeech thee for my ſonne Oneſimus,</hi> Philem. 9, 10. and a Sponſor, <hi>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account, I will repay it,</hi> ver. 18, 19. So Chriſt is both a Mediator and ſurety for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and 8. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the preſenting of his merits as a publike ſatisfaction, for the debt of ſin: for the juſtice of God would not be entreated or pacified without ſatisfaction, now that is for ever, becauſe he ſhall not ceaſe to appeare.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:55916:160"/> And ſo the Interceſſion of Chriſt implies three things.

               <p>The Saints on earth pray mutually one for another according to Gods commandement, not in their owne names, or for their owne merits, but for the merits, and in the name of Jeſus Chriſt: but the Interceſſion of Chriſt is no wayes reciprocall, he prayeth for all and every one that is given unto him of the Father, and that through the vertue of his ſacrifice, but they pray not for him.</p>
               <p>This Interceſſion of Chriſt is ever effectuall, becauſe the Father heareth and anſwereth him, and as he hath a power to intercede for us, ſo hath he power to conferre that upon us for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedeth. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, Joh. 14. 16.

Chriſt as man praying for himſelfe, was heard in that which he feared, though the Cup did not paſſe from him: but Chriſt as Mediatour is ever heard in the particular which he deſireth.</p>
               <p>Many and great benefits come to the Church of God by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt Jeſus. 1. Hereby the faithfull are aſſured of protection and defence againſt the continuall temptations, aſſaults and accuſations of all their ſpirituall enemies, Satan and the world. <hi>Who is he that condemneth?

               <p>But are not the faithfull ſubject to evills, corruptions and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſtill? how then is that part of the Interceſſion of Chriſt made good unto us?</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:55916:160"/> and ſealed but word after word, and line after line, and action af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter action: ſo the grant of our holineſſe is made unto Chriſt at firſt, but in the execution thereof, there is line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little; ſuch an order by Chriſt obſerved in the diſtribution of his Spirit and grace, as is moſt ſute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to a life of faith, and to the hope we have of a better King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet we ſee it did ſhake and totter: the prayer was not that there might be no failing at all, but that it might not utterly and totally faile.</p>
               <p>2. Hereby they are aſſured of the pardon of their daily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and their riſing againe if they fall. If any man ſinne of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, he hath a pardon of courſe granted, for Chriſt is his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to pleade his cauſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1. If any man ſlip of weakeneſſe, he ſhall riſe againe, for Chriſt hath prayed for him, that his faith might not faile, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 31, 32.</p>
               <p>3. All the workings and comforts of the Spirit in our hearts which we enjoy, are the fruits of Interceſſion. <hi>I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall give you another Comforter,</hi> or Advocate, <hi>that he may abide with you for ever, even the ſpirit of truth, Joh.</hi> 14. 16, 17. who ſhall leade the faithfull into all truth, and inable them to plead their cauſe againſt the calumnies of the devill, and accuſations of the world: who doth teach them to ſigh and groane unto God for mercy, ſpeake unto his highneſſe in prayer, furniſheth them with wiſedome and prudence in every condition, directeth them to grapple in all temptations, ſerve God in all eſtates, raiſeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to heaven, formeth Chriſt upon the heart, enflameth with the love and comfort of the truth, healeth, reneweth, reviveth, preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>4. The fourth benefit is free acceſſe to the throne of grace, and aſſured hope of all bleſſings here, and heaven hereafter. <hi>Seeing then that we have a great high Prieſt that is paſſed into the heavens, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Sonne of God, let us hold faſt our profeſſion, and come boldly unto the throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4. 14, 16. And againe, <hi>This man after he had offered one Sacrifice for ſinnes for ever, ſate downe on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footſtoole:</hi> from whence the Apoſtle inferreth, <hi>Having therefore boldneſſe to enter into the Holieſt by the blood of Jeſus, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55916:161"/> having an high Prieſt over the houſe of God, Let us draw neere with a</hi>

                  <hi>true heart, in full aſſurance of ſaith, Heb.</hi> 10. 12.—23.</p>
               <p>5. The prayers and workes of the faithfull are ſanctified and accepted in the ſight of God, the imperfections that cleave unto them being covered and removed; as the high Prieſt in the Law was to beare the iniquity of the holy things of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they might be accepted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 36, 38 Chriſt is the Angell of the Covenant, who hath a golden Cenſor to offer up the prayers of the Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. And this is a benefit which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth through the whole life of a Chriſtian: all the ordinary workes of our calling (being parts of our ſervice unto God, for in them we worke as Servants to the ſame Maſter) and workes of mercy and righteouſneſſe, are unto us ſanctified, and to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made acceptable, not-with-ſtanding the adherencie of ſinne unto them, by reaſon of our imperfections, by the interceſſion of<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 1, 2.</note> his Sonne, who hath made us Prieſts to offer our Sacrifices with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance upon this Altar, <hi>Rev. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Iſa. 65. 7. Phil.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>6. The ſixt benefit is fellowſhip with the Father and his Sonne, <hi>I pray for theſe, that as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, they alſo may be one in us, Joh.</hi> 17. 21.</p>
               <p>7. Continuance in the ſtate of grace, and ſtrength againſt ſin, ſo that the faithfull ſhall not finally be overcome, is the gratious and comfortable effect of Chriſts interceſſion. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not, Luk 22. 32. Father I will that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me, Joh.</hi> 17. 24. Some may ſay, in our Saviours prayer for <hi>Peter</hi> there was ſome-what ſingular. And every example is ſingular, and ſo this as an example: but it containes nothing ſingular which is not common to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſuch as are given unto Chriſt of the Father: for then we muſt ſay, Chriſt prayed ſo for <hi>Peter,</hi> as he prayed not for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who ſtood in more need of his Interceſſion then <hi>Peter,</hi> (if the matter be weighed according to the judgement of men,) who had obtained many priviledges. And if <hi>Peters</hi> faith ſhall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, becauſe Chriſt prayed for him, they for whom Chriſt makes interceſſion that their faith may not faile, they ſhall continue in faith unto the end. If they ſay, this priviledge was granted to <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apoſtle: then it was granted to all the Apoſtles: but this priviledge was not common to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:55916:161"/> It remaines then that it was given to him as a faithfull Apoſtle, and ſo agrees to all the faithfull with him. And the things which Chriſt asketh for his Apoſtles are to be diſtinguiſhed: for ſome things are ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, as that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from evill, and ſanctified by the truth; others which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine properly to the Apoſtolicall office. Now when Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth things neceſſary to Salvation, he prayeth not for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as Apoſtles, but as faithfull and beloved. For what things are asked for this or that man, as he executeth this or that office, they properly reſpect that office: but whatſoever things tend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the ſalvation of the Soule, are not to be reckoned amongſt the things which are peculiar, but which are common.</p>
               <p>Further they object, that Chriſt ever pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Chriſts Interceſſion is not for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as faithfull, but as given unto him of the Father: for Chriſt hath prayed for them that they might believe: Chriſts Interceſſion is not conditionall: for then that condition is purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt or not. If not, then ſome ſpirituall bleſſing is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us, which Chriſt hath not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. If yes, then Chriſt doth not deſire his might receive what he hath purchaſed. If Chriſts Interceſſion be conditionall, then what is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whether is that purchaſed by his death, or of our ſelves.</note> for the abſolute perſeverance of beleevers, but after a ſort, and upon condition. But the prayer of Chriſt is certaine, and not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. They for whom Chriſt prayed doe not love the world, but that they love not the world, is an effect of Chriſts prayers, not a condition required in them that he might pray for them. Some prayers raci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly include a condition in him for whom we pray, as if we pray God to give eternall life to a ſinner, we preſuppoſe faith and repentance: becauſe without faith and repentance life cannot be given, nor deſired: but ſome prayers preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no condition in him for whom we pray, as when we pray God to give faith or repentance to any man. Now the Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and requeſt which Chriſt maketh for the faithfull doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe no condition; for he prayeth not ſimply that life might ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply be given to the faithfull, but that they might be kept from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and if they be kept from evill, they muſt perſevere in the faith: for to fall from the faith is the greateſt evill. Neither can it be ſaid that Chriſt prayeth for them that would perſevere, but he prayeth that they ſhould perſevere: for the object of the thing for which we pray, muſt be diſtinct from the thing it ſelfe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. No man would pray for men to perſevere if they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere: but rather that they might perſevere, which otherwiſe would not. Yet they reply, Chriſt prayeth that his Apoſtles
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55916:162"/> might be kept from evill, as he had kept <hi>Judas. Joh.</hi> 17. 12. Belike then <hi>Peter</hi> had no greater aſſurance of his recovery, nor the reſt of the Apoſtles of their perſeverance in the faith, then <hi>Judas</hi> had. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was given to Chriſt in reſpect of his office and miniſtery, but not as an heire of Salvation, or as the faithfull are ſaid to be given; The particle tranſlated <hi>But,</hi> in that clauſe (<hi>But the child of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) is not ever an exceptive, but an adverſative in many places; as<note place="margin">

He emptied and humbled himſelfe, not by emptying and putting off his divine glory, but by ſuffering it to be over-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and to be humbled under the forme of a ſervant: and he is magnified at Gods right hand, as he doth manifeſt and ſhew forth his divine glory in his humane nature, which before was covered and ſhadowed therewith, as with a vaile. And how-ever we cannot ſay the Deity or divine nature was exalted in any other ſenſe then by evident manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it ſelfe in that man who was before deſpiſed, and accuſed as a blaſphemer, for that he made himſelfe equall with God, yet by reaſon of the communication of properties from one nature to another in the unity of one perſon, it is true that as God ſaved the world by his bloud, and the Prince of life was crucified, and the Lord lay in the Grave, ſo God was at the right hand of Majeſtie exalted again. The humane nature of Chriſt is moſt highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, as he hath obtained a new eminencie and dignity over all

But whileſt we ſay, Chriſt is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, his preſence in earth, in the Church, in the midſt of his enemies is not excluded. For the ſame Chriſt, who is man, is alſo God and every where. Chriſt in his body is in the heavenly and triumphant Church, abſent from the earth: by his infinite Deity he is preſent together in the earthly militant and heavenly. But concerning his Body we may truly conclude, becauſe he is in heaven, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not every where: for Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be made every where in the heavens, without a contradiction, no more then to be made infinite within limited bounds of being. This being taken for granted, that heaven can ſignifie nothing but a place limited for the extent of it. Chriſt as God and man hath power of rule over all things, by the eſſence of his Deity he is every where; by the eſſence of his humanity now he is in heaven: but he ruleth every where by the miniſteries of his domination. Where as man at the right hand of the Father, there he is ſaid to be as man in reſpect of place: and if where he ſits as ruling, there alſo he be in all places in his body, he is alſo in his body out of his body: then which nothing is more abſurd. Chriſt is received into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, by a mediatory action, which he executeth according to both natures, the word working what pertaineth to the word, and the fleſh what appertaineth to the fleſh. Chriſt is Mediatour, as God and man: and glory hath redounded unto him as God and man: and living in this glory he ruleth and governeth his Church as God and man. He aſcended into Heaven in his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: he ſitteth at the right hand of God as Mediatour in reſpect
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55916:166"/> of both natures; he worketh together with the Miniſters of the word by his divine and every where preſent efficacy.</p>

That is ſaid to be done in meaſure which is done ſparingly, moderately, in proportion: for he that gives bountifully or largely doth not meaſure or number what he giveth, but powreth out copiouſly, as we ſay, from the full heape or with both hands. And that which is plentifull, aboundant, full, is ſaid to be above meaſure, not that ſimply and abſolutely it is infinite, but in compariſon.

The Sunne is not greater, if it be beheld of many, not the leſſe, if of fewer: the ſame is true of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed.

This perſon as God, receiving by voluntary diſpenſation this honour from the Father, that he ſhould in an immediate and appropriate manner execute government over all creatures in heaven and earth; the ſame perſon as man participating in this Kingly divine authority, ſo farre that he ſhould inſtrumentally concurre in executing all that judgement which Chriſt according to his divine nature did principally effect. Though the Father and the Spirit have a right and ſoveraignty over the creature, yet they doe not immediatly execute this in ſuch manner as the Sonne doth, who hath received a right of executing immediatly and in a manner appropriat to his perſon, the ſoveraigne dominion of God over every creature. The Sonne by voluntary diſpenſation ſent by the Father, did emptie himſelfe of exerciſing and ſhewing forth his right and dominion over every creature: and the Father by voluntary diſpenſation doth reſigne to the Sonne the immediate execution of all power over every creature, till that time that all things be ſubdued under him. This the Scripture doth lay downe, as in regard of earthly pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5.</note> they are ſubject; for he is ruler of the Kings of the earth.

The evill Angells could not enter the Swine without his leave, and they are ſubject to his judgement: when the Saints ſhall judge the Angells, what power hath Chriſt himſelfe this way? And as for the excellencies on earth, they all receive their power from Chriſt, and are at his diſpoſe: yea the Apoſtle ſaith, He is crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  </note> The Apoſtle ſpeakes of that dominion which Chriſt received over all the creatures of God, none excepted: but if all things be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the feet of Chriſt, is not the humane nature every where? No: for the phraſe in Scripture is not to be underſtood of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction locall or corporall, but imperiall; ſc. that the man Chriſt is King of heaven and earth, having all things ſubjected to his command. This power and glory which Chriſt as man received is not infinite ſimply, for then it ſhould be the deity it ſelfe, which he ſhould not have had in the ſtate of humiliation: but the deity he had before, not by habituall infuſion, but by perſonall union. And if Chriſt by vertue of the hypoſtaticall union had received all fulneſſe of the God-head, that is, all divine Properties, as ſome interpret it, it is not poſſible he ſhould have received greater or more ample glory: for greater then that which is infinite cannot be beſtowed. But the Scripture ſpeaketh expreſſely, that Chriſt as man was truly and really glorified, or that he obtained that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Majeſty which before he had not, ſc. as man. And if the humane nature be infinite or eternall of neceſſity the Incarnation of Chriſt, and ſitting at the right hand of the Father muſt be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame, if they be not aboliſhed, and the humane nature made equall unto, if not the ſame with the divine.</p>

Now for the dwelling of all fulneſſe in Chriſt man, the latter two are in him ſubjectively: the former, that as the God-head doth dwell in Chriſt man, not as in the Saints by relation of love and communion of the effects of it in grace; nor as in the glorified Saints in regard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant love manifeſted in the gift of glory; nor any ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cohabitation: but it dwelleth in the manhood as with a nature which is taken to unity of perſon in the Sonne of God, and ſo is through grace become of the ſubſtance of the ſecond perſon. So that Chriſt as man hath the ſecond perſon of Trinity, God with the Father and Spirit dwelling perſonally in it: ſo that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is eſſentially and ſubſtantially coupled with the deity in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one ſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Chriſt man is fitly called God, and therefore in Chriſt man the God-head is ſaid to dwell properly: but Chriſt his humane nature may not be ſaid to be God, and therefore the God-head is not ſo fitly ſaid to dwell in the humane nature as in the perſon denominated after it, that is, in Chriſt man</p>

               <p>The fift thing implied in Chriſts ſitting at the right-hand of the Father is, that in ſpeciall he is the head of his Church. The word Head is uſed ſometime for one who in any kind is before or above other: and in this large ſence, Chriſt is the Head of the Angels, that is, their ruler or governour, one that is above them; man is the Head of the woman, Chriſt of man, God of Chriſt. But here it ſignifieth that Chriſt is ſo over his Church, that he is in a more neare and communicative ſort conjoyned with it, as the head is with the body and members. Looke as the King hath a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate and aimiable ſuperiority over his Queen than over any other ſubjects, ſo it is here in Chriſt our King, whoſe dominion towards his Church, who is his Spouſe and Queen, is more aimiably tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and nearly affected, then is his government over any other. Chriſt hath taken the ſelfe ſame holy and ſpirituall nature with his Church, ſtanding as well of that which is outward and ſenſitive, as of that which is inward and intellectuall. The faithfull are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him here by knowledge of faith and love, ſuch as Chriſt himſelfe by his Spirit begettet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Though betwixt the faithfull and Chriſts naturall body there be a bodily diſtance, yet the Spirit which commeth from Chriſt doth ſo joyne them with him, that nothing commeth twixt him and them.

And Chriſt having ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace and glory for all his, he cannot be but moſt ready to communicate with them every thing for their good. Chriſt is the Head of his Church, both as God and man our Mediatour. For did not the divine nature, which is the fountaine of all life natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſupernaturall dwell with this man or humane nature, we could not be enlightned or quickned by it. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath life in him;</hi> not that this nature of it ſelfe can doe theſe things, but becauſe the Deity dwelleth with it, and by it as by an inſtrument joyned perſonally with it, doth properly and efficiently worke theſe things. The omnipotent power of creating ſpirituall graces is not in the humane nature, nor the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent actions which doth produce them, doe or can proceed from the humane nature: but they are in God only, and from God in and with the humane nature, working to the ſame effects, according to its property. Chriſts humane nature hath both under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will whereby he worketh, and is an internall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment united within the perſon of God the Son, as a part of his perſon in a ſort, yea more neerly: but theſe divine works, which Chriſt the Mediatour worketh, the chiefe vertue and action, which properly effecteth them is in God, not communicated really with the other nature, though it doth worke them in this humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with it, yea and by it, as a moſt nearly conjoyned inſtrument, which within the perſon of God the Son hath his proper actions concurring in an inferiour degree of efficiency to that which the divine nature properly and principally worketh. God worketh graces, Chriſt man worketh the ſame: the divine nature crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them and infuſeth them into this or that man, through Chriſt man being as a common conceptacle or conduit-pipe. The humane nature worketh them not by powerfull creating them, but by taking away ſin and the cauſe, that ſo way might be made for this promiſed Spirit; by interceding Mediator-like for them; and by willing the going of ſuch graces from him, as who is with God the Son but one worker, though a diſtinct principle of working, that is, though diſtinct in nature, yet the ſame perſon. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worketh them as his own workes, from his owne power: for Gods power is by unity of perſon made his, the divine power not being without him, as the power of another perſon then he is
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55916:171"/> but being perſonally with him. And thoſe things which his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature worketh, which are wrought after his humane nature, the workes not of an humane, but a divine perſon: for though the nature, according to which they are wrought, be humane, yet the perſon working is the perſon of the Sonne of God. Hence it is that Chriſt-man doth give graces <hi>authoritativè &amp; effectivè,</hi> yea according to humane action doth effect them in the higheſt degree that an inſtrumentall operation can effect any thing.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> gives graces by laying on of hands with prayer, <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterialiter,</hi> not as his worke, but as intreating it from God in Chriſt, and ſignifying what God doth in Chriſt; not from any power any way within his perſon, but the power of another; not as conjoyned with God, as the body with the ſoule, but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument with God. Chriſt the Head of his Church is over all, to whom all things are ſubject. He who muſt be a ſaving head to us, there is great need he ſhould be over all. Could he not bind that ſtrong one, and cauſe him re-deliver his poſſeſſion, how ſhould we ever be ſet at liberty? Could he not diſſolve the worke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, ſwallow up death, create life and quickning in us, our caſe were lamentable?</p>
               <p>The ſixt thing implied is, That Chriſt God and man is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine odoration. Let all the Angels of heaven worſhip him. <hi>All knees ſhall bow unto him. All ſhall honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father. Yee believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. <hi>In him ſhall the Gentiles trust.</hi> So <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> called upon the Lord Jeſus ſaying, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> And the Apoſtles in the entrance of their Epiſtles deſire grace and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, not the Lord of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſome Heretikes would corrupt the text: and ſo in the ſhutting up of their Epiſtles; <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Christ, 1 Cor. 15. 23.

               <p>But ſome object that if adoration be due to Chriſt God and man, then it will follow, that the humane nature is omniſcient and almighty: which followeth not, becauſe that which is ſpoken of the concrete or whole perſon, is reſtrained to the one nature, which ſhould not be. The perſon adored or called upon is man, but the humanity it ſelfe only or ſolely, or in it ſelfe properly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:55916:171"/> is not the proper ſubject or object of that worſhip. Albeit we may and ſhould adore the man Chriſt with divine worſhip, yet may we not adore his man-hood, or his fleſh and bloud. Becauſe though the man Chriſt be God, yet his man-hood is not God, and by conſequence not to be worſhipped with that worſhip which is properly and eſſentially divine. Againe, if adoration agree to the humanity of Chriſt, then may his humanity helpe and ſave us. But the humanity of Chriſt cannot helpe and ſave us: becauſe <hi>omnis actio est ſuppoſiti,</hi> whereas the humane nature of Chriſt is not <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum.</hi> None of thoſe who defend the adoring of the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt with divine worſhip, doe well and warrantably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their opinion.</p>

The converſion of the nations to the faith of Chriſt is made by an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warre, deſtruction, and deſolation; wherein the King of kings fighteth againſt, ſubdueth, and bringeth under the diſobedient, which formerly did riſe up againſt him.

               <p>Men are gathered into the Kingdome of Chriſt by effectuall holy vocation, whereby Chriſt doth not only invite them by his Word to repent and beleeve, but by his Spirit doth aſſuredly bring<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> them unto himſelf, or unto the participation of the Covenant of mercy.

               <p>Vocation is partly externall, partly internall. Externall, by the Miniſtery of the Word, ordinarily propounded by men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily propounded immediately of God to the minde and will without the help of man. God doth ſometimes uſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of private perſons to bring men unto faith and repentance,<note place="margin">Jam. 5. 20.</note> and he is pleaſed to bleſſe the word of Exhortation or admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpoken by them: but ordinarily he maketh uſe of his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and ſervants to that purpoſe. Therefore our Saviour ſent<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20. 1 Cor. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 2 Cor. 6. 1. 2 Cor. 3. 3, 6. 1 Cor. 3. 5.

I deny not but in ſome caſes men may be converted by reading, or ſtudying the Scriptures, ſeeing it is the matter and not the manner which doth convert: and it cannot be ſhewed that God will not work
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55916:174"/> by reading, when the preaching of the Word is not neglected. The knowledge of arts and tongues may be acquired by good books, but moſt ordinary by inſtruction by lively voice: and beſt, when both are exerciſed with diligence and care: and ſo by the reading of the Scriptures a man may obtaine faith, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it commeth by the hearing of faith, though they profit moſt that joyn both together.</p>
               <p>The inſtrument of Vocation is the Word of God, or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Jeſus Chriſt: I meane, the whole doctrine of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">2 Theſ 2. 13.

So life and immortality is brought unto light through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: and the Apoſtles where-ever they came preached Jeſus, who unto them that are called both Jewes and Gentiles, is the power and wiſdome of God. <hi>God from the beginning</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the Theſſalonians) <hi>hath choſen you to Salvation, through ſanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth, whereunto he called you by our Goſpell, to obtaine the glory of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi> If the ſight of miſery be neceſſary to effectuall calling, that is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the Goſpell: for it teacheth, that without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God; And if man ſtand in need of a Saviour, he is loſt in himſelfe; ſo the preſcribing of the remedy doth diſcover the malady.

               <p>God doth freely give his Word to whom he pleaſe, as long as he pleaſe, and in what manner it ſeemeth beſt unto him in his infinite wiſdome. <hi>He gave his Law unto Jacob, his Statutes and Judgements unto Iſrael, he hath not dealt ſo with every Nation.</hi> The<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.

Thus Chriſt is ſet up for a ſigne, that ſhall be ſpoken againſt, and for a rock of offence, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. The Word is a morall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of converſion, which God is pleaſed to uſe, without which he doth not ordinarily work, but it hath no power of it ſelf to work: and therefore converſion is the immediate work of the holy Ghoſt, notwithſtanding the meanes which God uſeth in the turning of a ſinner. Naturall inſtruments being moved have ſome power to worke of themſelves, or by their own faculty; morall not ſo. The Word is a fit inſtrument, though of it ſelfe it have no power to produce the effect. For though converſion be not a bare morall perſwaſion, yet it is effected by perſwaſion, or at leaſt not without perſwaſion. In the change God dealeth with man as a reaſonable creature or inſtrument, which is to be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace, and allured by promiſes, ſweet, pleaſant, profitable, firme and ſure. Now the Word is very fit to convey thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and moſt forcible perſwaſions from the eare unto the ſoule.</p>
               <p>The Word is more generally publiſhed in the times of the Goſpell and Kingdome of the Meſſiah, then it had been in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. God is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation: the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell which hath been preached unto every creature under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,<note place="margin">Col. 1. 23.</note> that is, to all Nations, Jewes and Gentiles, and to all ſorts, and ſexes, noble, baſe, learned or unlearned, bond or free. And thus<note place="margin">Col. 1. 6. Mat. 28. 19, 20. Rom. 10. 21.</note> it did come unto them, they not minding it, or having it once in their thoughts. And hereof this is an argument, that it commeth, not where it is ſought, but where it is gainſaid. The Spirit was more abundantly poured forth upon the Church after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:55916:175"/> of Chriſt: The Paſtours of the Primitive Churches were faithfull and diligent: the primitive Chriſtians did<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1. 8.</note> not hide their candle under a buſhell, but did ſhine as lights to others, and labour their converſion: and the Goſpell like the Sunne for clearneſſe, did ſpread forth the beames of light more abundantly.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell is more glorious then the Law or truth of God manifeſted in the old Teſtament: that was as a Candle, that could not ſpread it light farre, this as the Sunne diſperſeth his<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> beames farre and nigh. It is the miniſtration of life, a quickning ſpirit, the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe, which ſhall endure for ever, and in this reſpect it doth exceed in glory, it is a Goſpell full of glory. If the types of Evangelicall things were glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, how much more glorious muſt the Goſpell it ſelf needs<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 27. Jam. 2. 8. 2 Cor. 3. 8, 9. 1 Theſ. 2. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 12.</note> be? The Goſpell is called a glorious Myſtery, a royall Law, a miniſtration of glory, nay, glory it ſelf; a glory which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſtudy and amazement of the moſt glorious creatures unto it.</p>
               <p>The publiſher of the Goſpell, is Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Sonne of God, who being in the boſome of the Father, the truth<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 18.</note> it ſelfe, and moſt familiarly acquainted with all his Counſells, hath revealed and brought it to light.</p>
               <p>The matter it ſelfe, is great Salvation, ſuch as eye hath not ſeen,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 3. 1 Cor. 2. 9.</note> care hath not heard, nor ever entered into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: Newes from heaven touching righteouſneſſe and life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, through faith in Jeſus Chriſt.

               <p>This word propounded by the miniſtery of man is not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory, as if an other word, which may be called conſummato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, muſt be ſuggeſted by the Spirit unto the minde.

For humane liberty is not a brutiſh, but a reaſonable thing: it conſiſteth not in contumacy and head-ſtrongneſſe, but in ſuch a manner of working, as is apt to be regulated, varied, or ſuſpended by the dictates of right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſound judgement, if things be diſtinctly and certainly apprehended, ſeriouſly weighed and pondered, and the thought thereof preſerved and kept in minde. The only cauſe why men are not willing to ſubmit unto Chriſt, is, becauſe they are not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in a manner ſutable to the excellency of the things, inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their minde, or they do not keep in minde and thought that which they are taught in the Word of God, and cannot but know in ſome ſort. Sinners in Scripture are ſaid to be blinde, ſimple, fooles, brutiſh, inconſiderate, that remember not that God ſeeth them, conſider not their latter end. Sinne is naturall, not as nature is oppoſed to liberty, but as nature is oppoſed to grace:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14. Rom. 8. 5, 6. 2 Cor. 11. 3. 1 Tim. 2. 14.</note> And ſo without Chriſt and the holy Spirit, miſerable, naturall or mortall men would ſinne neceſſarily. The firſt ſinne of our firſt parents was an errour: for whatſoever a man doth will, that he doth will being led by certaine reaſon, true, or in appearance. The act of willing hath in it power whatſoever is ſubject to it, but it ſelfe is not in it own power, but in the power of reaſon, whoſe preſcript it doth follow, whether right or corrupt. Neceſſarily good is preferred before evil, and the greater good certainly and diſtinctly knowne before the leſſer, but not knowne it is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55916:178"/> with equall neceſſity. The will is not enforced of it ſelfe, either of it ſelfe reſting, or forcing it ſelfe: for then it ſhould be in act and not in act, at one and the ſame time: The will cannot bend into the direct contrary: for then it might moſt willingly deſire that condition which it certainly knew to be moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and refuſe that condition which it moſt certainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly knew to be moſt bleſſed: Nor ſuſpend of it ſelfe, without the intervention of the underſtanding, becauſe the will is not the miſtreſſe of it ſelfe, but of the act, which depends upon the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour faculties. They that know the gift of God, they deſire and aske it. They that know God, they will truſt in him, and keep his Commandements. They that are taught of God, they will come unto Chriſt: and faith is lively and operative to draw men to the love of God, and obedience to his precepts.</p>
               <p>The act of judgement is two-fold: 1. Naturall, which ariſeth from the ſharpneſſe or dulneſſe of the wit. 2. Morall, according to which we are ſaid to be good or evil. There be two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of light. 1. Directing and warning what is to be done. 2. Perſwading and effectually moving forward the will. This perſwaſion is, when with ſuch force the holy Spirit doth accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Goſpell, that it doth not only move the will, but move it effectually or throughly, and beget faith lively and well rooted.

               <p>The anſwer is, that it is true, the will muſt not only be moved, but renewed and changed, before it can yeeld to Chriſt.

This habite is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it the will being in bondage, ſtained and defiled, it is altogether unable to will or deſire that which is ſpiritually good. If there could be a will without ſuch habite, man might performe the act of a man ſpiritually alive, before he was made alive. So that the full anſwer to this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> what is that effectuall help, whereby I come to God? is this: It is a mixt thing, ſtanding partly of that almighty power of his, put forth for my good, partly of that inward Word and inſpiration by and with which his power is put forth; partly in that ſpirit of faith and ſupernaturall life, which his almighty power through his Word bringeth forth in my ſoule. What was that help whereby Chriſt
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55916:179"/> made <hi>Lazarus</hi> able to come to him out of the grave of naturall death? The principall, was Chriſts power; the inſtrumentall, his voyce; the formall cauſe immediately helping to it, or working it, was the ſpirit of naturall life, which the power of Chriſt by his Word reſtored to this dead corps, which now was fallen. And thus we have the effectuall help or grace, by which we come actually to convert, which are all given from Gods free grace and favour towards us. And when God doth infuſe the habite of faith into the minde of one of ripe age, he doth cauſe him actually to beleeve, as the nature of the thing it ſelfe and condition doth manifeſt. For if the Spirit by inlightening the minde and renewing the heart doe perſwade and move the ſoule effectually to embrace, adhere unto, and love the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, then the condition of the thing will not beare, that grace ſhould be given effectually, but the act and motion of the ſoule muſt neceſſarily follow. But though the connection of theſe two be indiviſible, yet the flexion or turning it ſelfe is not indiviſible, or in a point or moment, but it may be ſooner or ſlower, more ſpeedy in one, more remiſſe in another. The will is neceſſarily bowed or bended, but more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one, more ſlackly in another, freely or willingly in all that are turned, and yet neceſſarily. And this firſt thing is well to be noted, for from hence we may gather in what ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the efficacy of grace, effectuall to Converſion, <hi>viz.</hi> In Gods effectuall power put forth to execute his intention, which he hath of converting ſome actually before other ſome.

For this doth argue there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, an incorrupted, connaturall diſpoſition to receive grace. This maketh the effect of Converſion as much, if not more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the active capacity of the will, as on the grace of God: For it maketh the grace of God worke it morally and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally by perſwaſion only, and the will of man from a power within it ſelfe, which doth more inwardly enter the effect of Converſion then the other.</p>
               <p>It may be queſtioned, in what order doth the Spirit make us come unto God, whether immediately, or by ſome preparation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before? wherein it is further to be conſidered, what that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is, or wherein it conſiſteth?</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:55916:179"/>
               <p>To the firſt branch of the Queſtion it is truly anſwered, that God doth uſe ſo to worke our comming to him by beliefe, that he doth firſt, for the moſt part prepare us thereunto. As before we engraffe a Sciens we cut it and ſet it for inciſion: and if a Timber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logg lie ſunke in mudd, men ſet to their tacklings, firſt to draw it out of the mire, before they lay it on a Cart to carry it away. Thus God doth by his power often worke ſome preparative change in a ſinner, before he doth by his power and word worke the ſpirit of faith in them, and make them come unto him. So God by afflictions is ſaid to boare the eare, and prepare to converſion.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 33. 11, 12. Act 2. 37.</note> When <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was humbled in great miſery, he ſought the Lord. Thus by conviction of ſin, others were pricked in heart, and ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi> and then ſpeedily they received the Goſpel beleeving. Sometimes by extraordinary ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours riſing from externall accidents, yea hidden naturall cauſes, God is pleaſed to bring men nearer unto him. Thus the Jaylor<note place="margin">Act. 16. 26, 27.</note> was prepared to receive the Goſpel by the ſhaking of the Caſtle, and that feare he fell into, ſuppoſing the priſoners had been fled. And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe by an extraordinary viſion was brought to<note place="margin">Act 9. 6.</note> great aſtoniſhment. Sometimes by reſtraining grace or common gifts, which make men for degree nearer, that is, in their kinde and ſtate not ſo much removed, as others in the ſame kinde and ſtate with them: God doth prepare men thus: Chriſt ſaid to the young man, who was nigh and unconverted, <hi>Thou art not farre</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 12. 34. and 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>from the Kingdome of God.</hi> Nay God may by giving a man up to the height of ſome ſin, or ſins, prepare him to converſion; as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the one left to perſecuting, the other to thoſe horrible out-rages. And God in wiſdome knew it beſt for <hi>Peter,</hi> to give him up to be tempted of Satan and left to himſelfe to deny his Maſter, for the curing of his ſelf-confidence. Phyſicians by ripening diſeaſes make way to cure them; for ſick matter is never more eaſily brought away, then when in ripeneſſe and quantity it exceedeth.</p>
               <p>Concerning this matter let theſe concluſions be remembred.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Theſe preparations are not abſolutely neceſſary: for we ſee God doth give ſanctifying grace to Infants, in whom none of theſe preparatory operations can take place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We doe not finde that they have been alwayes uſed, though perhaps it be a thing moſt commonly falling forth. How
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:55916:180"/> was <hi>Matthew</hi> called? even at his cuſtome: and he followed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 9. Luk. 19. 6.</note> not as <hi>Judas,</hi> but as a true convert of Chriſt. So <hi>Zacheus</hi> upon the very call, came downe haſtily, and received Chriſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. So it is ſaid of <hi>Lydia, God opened her heart, that ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>unto thoſe things which Paul ſpake.</hi> For life and death being ſuch contraries, as have no third thing between them, which doth partake in them both, the one may be changed into the other without any thing preparatory. The entring of grace doth expell corruption, and ſpirituall quickneſſe in newneſſe of life is the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin. Terrours doe not drive men to Chriſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſtirre men up to imbrace the promiſes: and God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw men unto Chriſt by the allurements of the Goſpell. By Evangelicall enticements men may be allured, as well as driven<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 14.</note> by the convictions and comminations of the Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All things which God doth prepare to the receiving of grace and comming to him, they make not of themſelves any thing to the introducing of grace, farther then God intendeth this effect by them. Feare of hell, conſcience of ſin, never ſuch affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, morall parts, and all gifts, which may be without ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace and true beliefe; many have all theſe, who yet never turne unfainedly unto God. When the ſickneſſe is growne greater in quantity, this abſolutely taken maketh the patient further off health. The feeling of the diſeaſe is no part of the recovery, though the Phyſitian may worke by it. Phrenſie in it ſelfe is no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to health, but to the Phyſitian, who can worke on the patient more fitly in this taking then in a deadly Palſey, it may be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to health. Thus to be like an aguiſh man on his good dayes, or like to ſome mad-men in the time of their intermiſſions, is in it ſelfe as fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re from ſtate of health, as otherwiſe: but yet the Phyſitian may uſe ſuch a ſtate, as a way to health, chooſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deale wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him in this taking, then in the fit. And ſo it is not the height of ſin, nor the feare of hell, nor a morall courſe of life, that of themſelves can make nearer the ſtate of grace, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of God, who doth intend to turne them hereunto. Afflictions of themſelves profit not, if God open not the ear: fear and horrour drive to deſpaire, if God ſupport not: vertuous life, according to the light of nature, turneth a man further from God, if he adde not thereunto the effectuall worke of his Spirit. And all, or any of theſe in regard of Gods intention, may prepare man to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:55916:180"/> receive the Goſpell or the grace of effectuall vocation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A man that is ſunke deeper into ſin may be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with leſſe ſorrow or legall terrour, as the Thiefe upon the Croſſe, and he that hath not ſo grievouſly offended may be kept longer under: for the ripeneſſe and aboundance of the humour may make way for the more ſpeedy removall thereof, when it is for the ſafety of others, that have not gathered ſo much corruption, to be kept under for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A Chriſtian muſt not quarrell his converſion, becauſe he hath not been terrified or brought ſo low as others, or kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo long: for it matters not how deeply thou haſt been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but how ſoundly thou haſt been cured: It is not materiall what paine thou haſt felt, but whether thou be brought unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſtians in temptations or diſtreſſe muſt not deſire or pray, that God would terrifie them, or humble them with deepe apprehenſions of his indignation: for they know not their owne ſtrength, whether they be able to beare it, if God ſhould deale ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; they forget that it is God that muſt make all afflictions profitable, and that of themſelves theſe things tend to deſpaire and hardneſſe of heart: and it is no ſmall unthankfulneſſe to complain of the Phyſitians care, becauſe he is inclined to deale tenderly with you. Godly ſorrow is to be cheriſhed, and ſo is the deſire of, and prayer for more tenderneſſe of heart: but when we pray for more horrour, we relie too much upon our ſelves, and yet conſider not our own weakneſſe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, This preparation is neither ſaving grace, nor a thing between nature and grace, done by the externall aide of the Spirit. It is not ſaving grace, becauſe it is that, whereby God is pleaſed to bring us to Chriſt, and not that, whereby we are renewed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or engraffed into Chriſt. Nor a thing between nature and grace; as if the Spirit without any habit of grace, did lift us up to the ſupernaturall acts of beliefe, hope, love: for then we ſhould be-lifted up to acts of life without the habit, which is to make a blinde man ſee without ſight, and to make us bear good fruit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſap, or before we be good trees.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Theſe things may diſpoſe us to faith, but not to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification immediately: becauſe the ſmart of the wound may provoke to ſeeke a plaiſter, but ſerveth not to the curing of it. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:55916:181"/> is of the free grace of God through the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and not through any habit of grace infuſed into us: much leſſe through feare of hell, or initiall hope, or deſire, or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Where the effectuall raiſing up of the heart to faith beginneth, there Gods preparative workes take an end: for as that which prepares the ground for ſeed now ceaſeth, when the ſeed is to be ſowne: So all theſe, which as they are prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fit the ſoul for Gods effectuall calling to be given, they have their end, when this immortall ſeed com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th to be ſown in us.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, whether the efficacie of grace depend upon the liberty of will; not whether grace hath its intrinſecall vertue to worke after the manner of grace, or a ſupernaturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent from the liberty of the will; which all men deny. Though if grace encline the will to a vitall and internall ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A cauſe in power only, is not a cauſe, but a cauſe in act applied, which is then ſufficient, and not potent only to doe ſomewhat, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in act it bringeth forth effect; ſufficient I ſay, not phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but morally, preſuppoſing the actuall application of it to that purpoſe. And on the other ſide, if the heart of ſtone be not taken away, ſufficient grace was not actually applied of God for that ſpeciall effect: for a fleſhie heart cannot be received by a ſtony, but the ſtony is removed by the fleſhie: There is the ſame reaſon of that grace of converſion, and of the grace that followeth after converſion: but the grace following converſion borroweth not its efficacy from the liberty of the will. That which God promiſeth to doe, cannot be the condition of the thing promiſed, becauſe the promiſe is precedent: but God promiſeth to give a new heart, and to put his Spirit into the inner man, and that not
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55916:181"/> for their ſakes, but of his free-grace. And this promiſe God did<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 32.</note> fulfill daily in the Church of the Jewes, but more ſparingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Iſa 40. 40.

That which the omnipotency of God is put forth to worke in the creature, that the creature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt. But God putteth forth his omnipotency, that by the effectuall working thereof, he may bring us to beleeve. To ſay that notwithſtanding Gods helping grace man may reſiſt, is to put grace in mans power, not to put mans will under the power of grace: to make man able to fruſtrate Gods counſell touching his converſion, and make God a lyar in that which he hath ſworne touching the gathering of his people.</p>
               <p>The worke of converſion is wrought in the will, not from any naturall power of ſuffering, but from the obedience in which it is to Gods almighty power, which it cannot but obey, and come to any thing whereunto he will bring it. For the will hath no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination to ſuffer any thing, both for the being and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it above nature, as in the eye now blinde there is no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power to receive ſight. And if there were a power naturall to receive converſion, then there muſt be ſome agent in nature able to worke converſion: for there is not found a power naturall of ſuffering in any thing, but there is found a power correſpondent working upon it.

But the will of man hath no cauſall force on God himſelfe, nor doth his will follow or attend upon the will of man.

For God cannot know this or that mans converſion certainly from eternity, but he muſt ſee it certaine in himſelfe, willing it, or in the cauſes of it, or he muſt ſee it from all eternity, as being preſent to himſelfe out of the cauſes.

               <p>A common cauſe doth not diſtinguiſh: but if grace be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them that believe, and them that believe not, it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the common cauſe of converſion, and doth not ſeparate the believer from the unbeliever. Men are ſaid to ſanctifie, purge and free themſelves, as the inſtruments of God, and free agents ſubordinate to grace predetermining: but the Scripture never ſaith that man is the cauſe, ſeparating himſelfe from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of reprobates externally called in like manner with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Converſion, as it is an act ſupernaturall in us, ſhould be the effect of divine vocation: but the cauſe of comparative vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſhould be the meere will or pleaſure of the creature. Grace and liberty cannot be mixed together in the partiality of the cauſe, becauſe liberty (as the Patrons of that opinion hold) is a free, indifferent, elective cauſe: but grace, a cauſe determinate to produce one effect. The uſe of grace is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of actuall grace to act. But if the efficacie of grace depend upon the liberty of mans will, neither grace preventing nor co-operating doth apply grace to it worke: not preventing grace, becauſe no meere power, as ſuch, doth actuate it ſelf: nor co-operating, becauſe in order of cauſality it goeth not before the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:55916:182"/> efficiency of the will. If God give to believe, and not only pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 19.</note> to believe, to believe, and not only to believe, when we will to believe; then by grace he determineth the will to believe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, will; and the efficacie of grace is reduced unto God, willing and determining. And if he worke in us both to will and to doe,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.

               <p>To what end doe the promiſes and threatnings tend (may ſome man ſay) if God doe worke all things by his effectuall power in them that believe?

                  </note> worke of God, then man doth not repent and believe, but God. But this followeth not: for repentance is the gift of God, but the act of man. God is the cauſe of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, efficient, but not formall: the cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and effective, but not vitally efficient. The determination of God externall, and vitall volition differ as cauſe and effect: for he worketh in us to will: but volition doth not worke to will: the determination of God as efficient is externall, and reſpecteth the will in the firſt act of its influx, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall determination is internall, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth good to be choſen or to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>In man not converted two things are to be conſidered; native contumacy, and the not curing of that native contumacy. The native contumacy, is of themſelves, as darknes from the earth: the not curing of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacy is of God, as a cauſe phyſicall, becauſe he can cure it, but doth not; but not as a Morall cauſe, becauſe he is not bound to heale or cure it. The effect of God not curing this native contumacy, is only a negative non-conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion phyſicall or not culpable, as a morall effect. The abſence of the ſunne is the cauſe why the darkneſſe of the night is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but the darkeneſſe it ſelfe is not from the ſunne. Fault is a morall defect, and cannot ariſe but from a morall cauſe and deficient. Culpable non-converſion is a conſequent of Gods not curing our native contumacy, but no effect thereof, as of a morall cauſe: becauſe God is not bound to remove it either by Law, debt, juſtice, promiſe, or Covenant, and betwixt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, and Gods not-converſion, the free willing of the corrupt will, and voluntary love of native contumacy doth intercede.

               <p>IN the matter of Salvation it pleaſed God to deale with man by way of ſtipulation and promiſe, and ſo likewiſe in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the participation of the Covenant. For though this Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be every way free, gracious and abſolute, as the Spirit worketh where he liſteth, yet in the Goſpel, which is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Vocation, it pleaſeth God to propound both the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he requireth, and the promiſe which he hath made. The promiſe, as an argument to move us the rather to give our ſelves unto Chriſt, and to doe what is required. The preſcription of what he requireth, as that condition, without which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtaine, and by which moſt certainly we ſhall obtaine what good is promiſed. Effectuall Vocation on Gods part is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull invitation and aſſured drawing of the weary and thirſty ſoule unto Chriſt, that in him it might finde refreſhing and comfort.</p>
               <p>The anſwer on our part, is a free and willing comming unto<note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28, 29. Joh. 6. 44. and 6. 35, 37.</note> Chriſt, that in him we might be ſatisfied; the embracing of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and lodging him in our boſome. And therefore that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:55916:185"/> which firſt of all receiveth that Vocation, is faith, whereby we believe, that if a man performe the condition, he ſhall poſſeſſe the promiſe, if he come unto Chriſt, he ſhall be ſatisfied: but if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme not the thing required, he ſhall not enjoy the promiſe; he ſhall not be ſatisfied, if he drinke not the water of life. And not only ſo, but he ſhall continue poore, naked, blinde, miſerable, captive, a priſoner, an alien from the Covenant, and without God in the world: nay, he ſhall be puniſhed with contrary evils, according to the nature of the Covenant divine, where there is no promiſe without a commination contrary to it. This faith is grounded upon the free and gracious Covenant, whereby God is pleaſed to binde himſelfe firſt unto us, before he binde us unto himſelfe, that his promiſe might be apprehended as the ground of our faith, upon which we ſhould firmely beleeve: And upon the<note place="margin">Iſai. 55. 1, 2.

               <p>And here the doubt touching the precedency of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance may eaſily be determined. For if faith be taken largely or generally for a beliefe of the promiſe, if we repent and receive it, then faith is before repentance: for there can be no turning without hope of pardon, nor comming home by hearty ſorrow, without ſome expectation of mercy. Thus the Exhortations run, <hi>Turn unto the Lord, for he is mercifull and gracious. Repent, for the Kingdome of God is at hand.</hi> But if faith be taken more ſtrictly, for that faith or beliefe whereby we receive, embrace, or reſt upon the promiſe of God in Chriſt Jeſus for pardon and forgiveneſſe, then repentance goeth before pardon: for no remiſſion is promiſed to<note place="margin">Mark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Luke 24. 47.</note> be enjoyed but upon condition of repentance; and if the penitent only be immediately capable of pardon, then pardon is received by a penitentiall faith. If repentance be neceſſary to Juſtification, of neceſſity it muſt goe before juſtifying faith; becauſe faith and juſtification are immediately coupled together. It is impoſſible to come unto Chriſt without repentance, but to come unto Chriſt is to embrace or receive him ſoundly and effectually to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of the ſoul. Comming unto Chriſt is a lively motion of the ſoul, wherein ariſing from ſin, it draweth nigh or approacheth unto Chriſt, that in him it might be ſatisfied. The motion is one, but the points are two. For in drawing nigh unto Chriſt, the ſoul ariſeth from ſin: which may be called repentance. Of the ſignification of the word, I will move no queſtion at this time: but take repentance for a comming unto Chriſt by true, godly ſorrow, from whom we had formerly departed by ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the extreme hazard of our ſouls.</p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:55916:186"/>
               <p>The Author of repentance, is God in Jeſus Chriſt. Repentance<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25. Jer. 31. 18.</note> is the gift of God, but the act of man. It is man that repenteth and not God: but it is God that giveth repentance, inableth, and moveth man to repent. Regeneration is the act of God: repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the act of man. In ſubject they both agree; for he that is<note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 25.</note> regenerate doth alſo repent, and ſo on the contrary: but in their formall conſideration and peculiar nature they are diſtinct. Chriſt alſo as Mediatour is the principall cauſe of repentance: for him hath God exalted to give repentance unto Iſrael. And ſeeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance<note place="margin">Act. 5. 31.

Repentance is the effect of Chriſts death and interceſſion. As he hath purchaſed pardon of ſin for us, ſo repentance alſo, otherwiſe we ſhould be<note place="margin">Iſai. 53. 5.</note> partakers of ſome ſaving grace, or bleſſing, which Chriſt did not purchaſe for us.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of God is not undeſervedly called the Spirit of Chriſt as Mediatour, convincing the Conſcience of ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, and diſcovering unto the heart the grace of the Goſpell. The Word of the Kingdome or Covenant is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of repentance, as that which diſcovereth ſin, and holdeth forth hope of pardon, and intreateth, perſwadeth, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth the weary and burdened to draw nigh to God by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
